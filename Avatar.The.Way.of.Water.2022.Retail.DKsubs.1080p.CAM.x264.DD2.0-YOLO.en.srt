1
00:00:54,273 --> 00:00:56,273
..:: YOLO - Your
Source Of Quality::..

2
00:00:56,297 --> 00:01:00,294
Pandora's forests
hold many dangers.

3
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:10,152
But the most dangerous
thing about Pandora is…

4
00:01:14,002 --> 00:01:17,016
that you can come to
like her too much.

5
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:35,230
We sing the chords to remember.
Each pearl is a story from our life.

6
00:01:37,465 --> 00:01:40,455
A gem for the birth of our son.

7
00:01:43,947 --> 00:01:45,918
Not finished!

8
00:01:45,943 --> 00:01:47,938
Not finished!

9
00:01:54,544 --> 00:01:57,542
A gem for our adopted
daughter, Kiri, -

10
00:01:58,484 --> 00:02:01,656
- born of Grace's avatar, -

11
00:02:01,681 --> 00:02:04,684
- and whose conception
was a complete mystery.

12
00:02:18,615 --> 00:02:21,617
A gem for the first
meeting with Eywa.

13
00:02:25,008 --> 00:02:28,993
The people say we
live in Eywa, -

14
00:02:29,408 --> 00:02:32,410
- and Eywa lives in us.

15
00:02:34,098 --> 00:02:39,084
The almother takes care
of all her children.

16
00:02:47,098 --> 00:02:49,103
Happiness is straightforward.

17
00:02:50,413 --> 00:02:53,429
Think a toad like
me would find it.

18
00:02:56,434 --> 00:03:01,074
The first time I met your
father, I tried to kill him.

19
00:03:01,099 --> 00:03:03,081
Love at first sight.

20
00:03:03,448 --> 00:03:06,439
Before I knew it, we had four.

21
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:13,080
We sent the sky people back to
Earth, but some stayed here.

22
00:03:13,104 --> 00:03:16,095
Scientists who were
loyal to the Na'vi.

23
00:03:17,117 --> 00:03:20,742
And then there was Spider.
He was trapped here.

24
00:03:20,863 --> 00:03:23,849
Too young for a cryocapsule.

25
00:03:23,944 --> 00:03:29,929
The war had taken his parents, so
he was raised by the scientists.

26
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:36,094
He was like a stray cat
that kept coming running.

27
00:03:37,098 --> 00:03:40,088
He and our kids
were inseparable.

28
00:03:42,773 --> 00:03:47,976
To Neytiri he would always
be a stranger. One of them.

29
00:03:48,001 --> 00:03:51,011
He belongs among his own.

30
00:03:54,711 --> 00:03:58,695
- I had it first!
- Why do you have to have it?

31
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:01,707
I was a few years away from having
the language hammered into the tuber.

32
00:04:01,897 --> 00:04:04,874
But now it comes
naturally to me.

33
00:04:05,102 --> 00:04:07,068
I hate you!

34
00:04:07,092 --> 00:04:11,070
I hate you to no end,
Lo'ak! Crazy face!

35
00:04:11,094 --> 00:04:15,076
Whoa, that's good. Soon
firewood falls down.

36
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:20,087
He immediately emerges from
the rocks. There he is.

37
00:04:21,911 --> 00:04:23,917
Like, take it.

38
00:04:25,188 --> 00:04:30,169
Neteyam, the great
fisherman. Good boy.

39
00:04:33,269 --> 00:04:38,276
- It's a big crab.
- By the stones, as you said.

40
00:04:38,654 --> 00:04:41,765
- How tall is he? - So tall.

41
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:44,806
Time flies. Like a dream.

42
00:04:46,126 --> 00:04:49,117
- Kiri. - Come here, bro.

43
00:04:50,031 --> 00:04:51,140
Smile, skxawng.

44
00:04:51,866 --> 00:04:53,875
Happiness is straightforward.

45
00:04:56,931 --> 00:04:59,926
It can be a date night
without children.

46
00:05:31,102 --> 00:05:34,086
There's just that about luck...

47
00:05:36,084 --> 00:05:38,099
that it can end abruptly.

48
00:05:44,086 --> 00:05:46,104
A new star in the night sky.

49
00:05:47,099 --> 00:05:50,095
That could only mean one thing.

50
00:05:56,093 --> 00:05:59,085
Ships slowing down.

51
00:06:07,101 --> 00:06:09,106
The Sky People had returned.

52
00:08:28,093 --> 00:08:32,092
A YEAR LATER

53
00:08:39,093 --> 00:08:42,072
The pulse rises.

54
00:08:42,096 --> 00:08:46,102
They'll probably make
it. Take it easy.

55
00:08:48,099 --> 00:08:50,104
Good pupillary reaction.

56
00:08:51,084 --> 00:08:52,079
Remove it there.

57
00:08:52,103 --> 00:08:55,106
Colonel, can you hear me?

58
00:08:59,088 --> 00:09:02,095
Please lie down.

59
00:09:06,084 --> 00:09:08,100
- Stun him! - Hurry up!

60
00:09:09,106 --> 00:09:12,082
- Call the guards! - Grab him!

61
00:09:12,106 --> 00:09:16,078
Hold him! Calm down, Colonel!

62
00:09:16,102 --> 00:09:20,093
It's me, Corporal Wainfleet!

63
00:09:22,104 --> 00:09:26,082
Lyle? Is it you?

64
00:09:26,106 --> 00:09:29,090
Yes, and Z Dog.

65
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:32,100
And Fig.

66
00:09:35,087 --> 00:09:38,095
Just let me go. I'm
completely calm.

67
00:09:59,096 --> 00:10:03,099
It didn't matter.

68
00:10:12,106 --> 00:10:17,086
Attention. Two minutes
to land on Pandora.

69
00:10:19,087 --> 00:10:21,074
The umbilical cord is gone.

70
00:10:21,098 --> 00:10:23,095
Oxygen uptake: 89.

71
00:10:24,096 --> 00:10:28,067
In case you were in any doubt,
you are Colonel Miles Quaritch, -

72
00:10:28,091 --> 00:10:33,077
- just younger, taller,
bluer and less pretty.

73
00:10:33,101 --> 00:10:37,070
In two hours I will
attack the Na'vi fortress.

74
00:10:37,094 --> 00:10:42,068
It was thought advisable
that I make this backup.

75
00:10:42,092 --> 00:10:47,092
And if you see it, it means
I've put the clogs away.

76
00:10:48,106 --> 00:10:52,075
Parker, what the
hell else can I say?

77
00:10:52,099 --> 00:10:56,073
Just remind him how it works.

78
00:10:56,097 --> 00:11:00,079
Your memories and your personality
are sent back to Earth, -

79
00:11:00,103 --> 00:11:04,106
- where you are being cultivated.
You will have them instilled…

80
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:08,105
Is it me or you doing this?

81
00:11:09,085 --> 00:11:14,073
The idea is to transfer the psyche from
the toughest extraterrestrial actors -

82
00:11:14,097 --> 00:11:20,078
- as Corporal Wainfleet
there and signed -

83
00:11:20,102 --> 00:11:22,105
- til recombinant body.

84
00:11:23,085 --> 00:11:27,082
You are a recombinant souled
with my memories and my charm.

85
00:11:27,106 --> 00:11:31,105
You won't be able to remember my
death because it hasn't happened yet.

86
00:11:32,085 --> 00:11:35,067
And it won't come
to that either.

87
00:11:35,091 --> 00:11:40,082
Whatever happened, you as a clone
of me will thirst for revenge, -

88
00:11:40,106 --> 00:11:44,098
- primarily over Jake Sully.

89
00:11:46,686 --> 00:11:49,682
Remember that a Marine
can never be defeated.

90
00:11:49,706 --> 00:11:54,706
You can kill us, but
we'll regroup in hell.

91
00:11:55,686 --> 00:11:57,686
Semper fi.

92
00:12:24,697 --> 00:12:26,688
Land force, now!

93
00:13:20,686 --> 00:13:22,694
Day ago!

94
00:13:26,688 --> 00:13:28,691
Two minutes, guys.

95
00:13:32,688 --> 00:13:36,667
- We have to go down there, bro.
- Father will kill us.

96
00:13:36,991 --> 00:13:38,977
Now don't be such a douchebag.

97
00:13:39,001 --> 00:13:41,992
Lo'ak, come back!

98
00:13:44,994 --> 00:13:47,999
The entire box must be included,
both magazines and rocket guides.

99
00:13:51,997 --> 00:13:54,990
- Come on bro! - Lo'ak!

100
00:13:56,985 --> 00:13:59,981
Take it. Take a weapon, kid.

101
00:14:00,005 --> 00:14:03,997
Lo'ak, you don't even
know how to use it.

102
00:14:04,993 --> 00:14:06,006
Dad showed me that.

103
00:14:14,004 --> 00:14:16,001
A helicopter gunship!

104
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,985
Come on bro!

105
00:14:34,984 --> 00:14:37,968
Lo'ak, where are you? Netay!

106
00:14:37,992 --> 00:14:41,966
Are you unharmed?
where is your brother

107
00:14:41,990 --> 00:14:44,006
- Over there. - Hurry away!

108
00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:46,998
Not finished!

109
00:14:49,003 --> 00:14:51,000
Oh no.

110
00:15:00,994 --> 00:15:01,994
Far?

111
00:15:04,994 --> 00:15:06,994
What the hell were
you doing here?

112
00:15:07,998 --> 00:15:09,990
Pardon.

113
00:15:10,994 --> 00:15:12,002
Sorry, Dad.

114
00:15:15,909 --> 00:15:18,923
We're not in Kansas anymore.

115
00:15:19,903 --> 00:15:21,923
We're on our way to Pandora.

116
00:15:22,904 --> 00:15:27,906
I know you are all asking
yourselves the same question:

117
00:15:30,902 --> 00:15:32,907
Is it blue monday?

118
00:15:35,918 --> 00:15:40,894
The sins of the past have made us
reborn in the form of our enemies.

119
00:15:40,918 --> 00:15:44,922
We have their size, their
strength, their speed.

120
00:15:45,902 --> 00:15:49,915
Added to our training,
it's a powerful cocktail.

121
00:15:50,921 --> 00:15:54,885
- Have we got a mission?
- We have that.

122
00:15:54,909 --> 00:15:58,921
Our mission is to find and kill
the leader of the na'vi rebel army.

123
00:15:59,921 --> 00:16:02,922
Him they call "toruk makto".

124
00:16:03,902 --> 00:16:04,923
Jake Sully.

125
00:16:13,917 --> 00:16:17,891
Attack, attack! Got you!

126
00:16:17,915 --> 00:16:18,923
Come on now, Tuk.

127
00:16:19,904 --> 00:16:24,894
I'm clearly faster when I'm blue.
And the animals show me more respect.

128
00:16:24,918 --> 00:16:29,907
- They don't see me as a person.
- Wait, are you human?

129
00:16:38,906 --> 00:16:39,898
They are coming!

130
00:16:39,922 --> 00:16:43,908
THE FORTRESS OF THE OMATIKAYAS

131
00:16:44,908 --> 00:16:46,896
They come! Kiri! Spider!

132
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:50,885
The warriors have
returned! Came!

133
00:16:50,909 --> 00:16:51,916
Come along.

134
00:17:06,909 --> 00:17:09,901
- Mor! - Tuck, Tuck, Tuck.

135
00:17:11,911 --> 00:17:13,908
Step up.

136
00:17:15,901 --> 00:17:19,922
You are scouts. You must keep an
eye out for enemies. At a distance!

137
00:17:20,902 --> 00:17:26,883
Does that sound familiar? Here I let
you fly a mission and then you disobey.

138
00:17:26,907 --> 00:17:30,923
- Kiri, help with the wounded.
- My brother is also injured.

139
00:17:31,904 --> 00:17:35,899
- Tuk, go with her.
- Father, I take full responsibility.

140
00:17:35,923 --> 00:17:40,906
Yes, because you are the oldest
and you must behave accordingly.

141
00:17:41,910 --> 00:17:46,908
- MaJake, your son is bleeding.
- It doesn't matter, mother.

142
00:17:48,910 --> 00:17:50,910
Go in and get patched up.

143
00:17:56,905 --> 00:18:00,923
You must be aware that you
almost had your brother killed.

144
00:18:02,923 --> 00:18:05,888
You are banned from
flying for a month.

145
00:18:05,912 --> 00:18:10,903
Look at the Ukrainians. All of them.
And wipe the nastiness off your face.

146
00:18:18,912 --> 00:18:21,923
- Should I breathe on it?
- Give him this.

147
00:18:22,903 --> 00:18:27,882
- I would use yalnabark.
- Aha. Who is tsahik here?

148
00:18:27,906 --> 00:18:31,923
You are, grandma, but
yalnabark is better.

149
00:18:34,908 --> 00:18:37,902
- It hurts less.
- Mighty warriors.

150
00:18:44,922 --> 00:18:46,901
What is it?

151
00:18:48,913 --> 00:18:52,890
Neteyam and Lo'ak try
to live up to you.

152
00:18:52,914 --> 00:18:55,889
It's hard for them.

153
00:18:55,913 --> 00:18:57,913
I know.

154
00:18:58,923 --> 00:19:00,923
You are hard on them.

155
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:07,890
I am their father.
That's my job.

156
00:19:07,914 --> 00:19:10,921
We are not a platoon.
We are a family.

157
00:19:22,901 --> 00:19:24,923
I thought we had lost him.

158
00:19:32,914 --> 00:19:35,881
- Hi there. - Hey, Spider.

159
00:19:35,905 --> 00:19:38,888
- I'll knock you out.
- Just come.

160
00:19:38,912 --> 00:19:41,921
Only avatars are allowed
here. Walk around.

161
00:19:42,901 --> 00:19:46,922
- The blue stripes don't make you bigger.
- I can still spread you out.

162
00:19:50,912 --> 00:19:53,907
- What a day. - It was long.

163
00:19:54,921 --> 00:19:59,893
Very funny. It is so clean down there
that you can breathe earth air for hours.

164
00:19:59,917 --> 00:20:02,899
I can only inhale
yours for ten seconds.

165
00:20:02,923 --> 00:20:07,906
Yes, it's downright,
monkey cat. For you.

166
00:20:13,905 --> 00:20:15,919
- Hey, Max. - Hey, kids.

167
00:20:23,908 --> 00:20:25,916
Hi Mom.

168
00:20:34,923 --> 00:20:39,887
Maybe I'm getting cocky,
but I see real evidence -

169
00:20:39,911 --> 00:20:43,921
- on a systemic response
at global level.

170
00:20:44,901 --> 00:20:46,886
I can not...

171
00:20:46,910 --> 00:20:50,886
I will not use the
word "intelligence".

172
00:20:50,910 --> 00:20:53,885
"Awareness" is
probably a better word.

173
00:20:53,909 --> 00:20:57,886
It's as if the entire
biosphere on Pandora -

174
00:20:57,910 --> 00:21:02,907
- is conscious and able
to respond cognitively.

175
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:08,896
I can't say that.
Then they crucify me.

176
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:12,895
Who do you think did her roe?

177
00:21:12,919 --> 00:21:16,887
- It was guaranteed Norm.
- Definitely.

178
00:21:16,911 --> 00:21:19,897
- You don't deserve to live.
- Think about it.

179
00:21:19,921 --> 00:21:22,899
He is with her constantly.

180
00:21:22,923 --> 00:21:26,889
I wanted to commit suicide.
I wanted to drink acid.

181
00:21:26,913 --> 00:21:31,901
He is in all recordings. Look
at the look he gives her.

182
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:37,884
I imagine their avatars
together out in the woods…

183
00:21:37,908 --> 00:21:38,897
Ad!

184
00:21:38,921 --> 00:21:42,917
It's not always cool to
know who your father was.

185
00:21:47,904 --> 00:21:50,888
Hole in it. I don't
even remember him.

186
00:21:50,912 --> 00:21:52,891
No, Spider...

187
00:21:52,915 --> 00:21:55,897
Spider...

188
00:21:55,921 --> 00:21:58,909
You are not him.

189
00:22:06,909 --> 00:22:09,907
BRIDGEHEAD CITY

190
00:22:37,922 --> 00:22:40,894
Inside the terminal!

191
00:22:40,918 --> 00:22:43,909
No stay! Go!

192
00:22:46,907 --> 00:22:48,913
Masks off.

193
00:22:52,903 --> 00:22:55,911
Colonel, it's the general.

194
00:23:04,907 --> 00:23:05,919
General Ardmore.

195
00:23:06,923 --> 00:23:10,884
Nice to meet you, Colonel.
I hear good things.

196
00:23:10,908 --> 00:23:14,915
But a lot has changed since
you were here last. Came.

197
00:23:17,901 --> 00:23:21,885
The new command center here
has just been commissioned.

198
00:23:21,909 --> 00:23:25,888
The crowd fitters can erect
a building in six days.

199
00:23:25,912 --> 00:23:30,896
We have done more here in one year
than in the previous 30 years.

200
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:37,911
We are not here to run a mine. I
have a far more important mission.

201
00:23:41,911 --> 00:23:43,889
The earth is dying.

202
00:23:43,913 --> 00:23:47,888
Our task is to tame
the wilderness -

203
00:23:47,912 --> 00:23:52,922
- with the aim of making Pandora
the new home of humanity.

204
00:23:53,902 --> 00:23:58,913
But before we can do that, we
have to pacify the savages.

205
00:24:00,905 --> 00:24:04,889
Sully's whims have become
bolder and more frequent.

206
00:24:04,913 --> 00:24:09,899
His attacks are well executed. There is
good coordination between the troops.

207
00:24:09,923 --> 00:24:15,894
They go after mines and pipelines
and sabotage our supply chain.

208
00:24:15,918 --> 00:24:19,911
They attacked a mag
train two days ago.

209
00:24:23,909 --> 00:24:28,923
- Do we know anything about Sully's base?
- Yes. Show me the mountains.

210
00:24:29,903 --> 00:24:32,911
There is a cave system in
the Hallelujah Mountains.

211
00:24:34,918 --> 00:24:38,923
But every time we send troops
up there, we suffer losses.

212
00:24:39,904 --> 00:24:42,921
It's like poking a wasp's nest.

213
00:24:43,901 --> 00:24:47,920
After ten minutes in their
airspace they swarm around us.

214
00:24:49,913 --> 00:24:53,894
Colonel, we think your blue team
will be mistaken for natives -

215
00:24:53,918 --> 00:24:56,890
- and not trigger
an immune reaction.

216
00:24:56,914 --> 00:24:59,908
How do we test that hypothesis?

217
00:25:00,911 --> 00:25:02,904
The hard way.

218
00:25:03,910 --> 00:25:05,910
Wonderful.

219
00:25:18,907 --> 00:25:22,903
- We are approaching enemy airspace.
- Received.

220
00:25:32,914 --> 00:25:35,923
- Come on, monkey!
- Wait for me!

221
00:26:12,917 --> 00:26:16,889
- Tuk, come on. - Okay, okay.

222
00:26:16,913 --> 00:26:18,891
Why did you bring her?

223
00:26:18,915 --> 00:26:23,884
The honking princess. "I'm gossiping.
You must not go out to the battlefield.

224
00:26:23,908 --> 00:26:26,923
I'll tell mother if
you don't take me."

225
00:26:28,911 --> 00:26:29,920
Come on.

226
00:26:30,923 --> 00:26:34,916
- How crazy! - Is there a body?

227
00:27:21,901 --> 00:27:22,912
Hold that up.

228
00:27:32,909 --> 00:27:35,908
Kiri? Kiri.

229
00:27:38,908 --> 00:27:40,923
Kiri. Kiri...

230
00:27:47,902 --> 00:27:51,888
- Are you okay?
- I did it again, didn't I?

231
00:27:51,912 --> 00:27:53,913
Yes, you did.

232
00:27:54,911 --> 00:27:56,886
Skin!

233
00:27:56,910 --> 00:27:58,918
- We have to see to come back.
- Came.

234
00:28:04,781 --> 00:28:06,757
What is it?

235
00:28:06,781 --> 00:28:09,789
We must be home before dark.

236
00:28:11,776 --> 00:28:14,763
- Too big to be human.
- Avatars?

237
00:28:14,787 --> 00:28:17,787
Maybe, but not any of ours.

238
00:28:19,779 --> 00:28:21,788
- What are you doing?
- Following the tracks.

239
00:28:40,796 --> 00:28:42,796
Keep your back covered.

240
00:28:45,788 --> 00:28:47,776
Secured.

241
00:28:49,793 --> 00:28:51,776
Make a call.

242
00:29:04,785 --> 00:29:06,781
Holy shit.

243
00:29:27,797 --> 00:29:30,768
We shouldn't be here at all.

244
00:29:30,792 --> 00:29:35,773
Dad gives you a no-fly zone
for the rest of your life.

245
00:29:35,797 --> 00:29:39,778
We have to look into it.

246
00:29:55,792 --> 00:30:01,759
Bro, that's where your
father and my father fought.

247
00:30:01,783 --> 00:30:05,780
- It's your father's suit.
- Holy shit...

248
00:30:06,783 --> 00:30:09,797
Lyle, check for
data on the camera.

249
00:30:11,776 --> 00:30:14,789
- It's stone dead, Colonel.
- We were too.

250
00:30:15,793 --> 00:30:19,793
- I have to report this.
- We get so much trouble.

251
00:30:24,777 --> 00:30:28,774
- They will Dog, it's Eagle Eye.
- Eagle Eye, come forward.

252
00:30:28,798 --> 00:30:34,757
I've spotted someone.
They look like avatars, -

253
00:30:34,781 --> 00:30:39,767
- but they wear camouflage and
assault rifles. There are six of them.

254
00:30:39,791 --> 00:30:42,759
What is your position?

255
00:30:42,783 --> 00:30:45,779
We are at the old cabin.

256
00:30:47,779 --> 00:30:49,765
Who are we"?

257
00:30:49,789 --> 00:30:52,781
Me, Spider, Kiri...

258
00:30:53,787 --> 00:30:55,794
and Tuk.

259
00:30:59,798 --> 00:31:03,797
Now you are listening very
well. Retreat silently.

260
00:31:04,777 --> 00:31:09,778
- Hurry out of there. Understood?
- Yes. We are on the way.

261
00:31:10,786 --> 00:31:12,788
Dad, I know a loophole.

262
00:31:18,782 --> 00:31:22,767
- You get into so much trouble.
- Now stop, Kiri.

263
00:31:22,791 --> 00:31:25,777
It's eclipse right away.

264
00:31:26,787 --> 00:31:30,772
- Put it down or I'll shoot!
- Come with me.

265
00:31:30,796 --> 00:31:32,780
- Drop it! - Right now!

266
00:31:34,787 --> 00:31:35,798
Put it, put it.

267
00:31:39,791 --> 00:31:44,774
Come here! Down on your
knees! Stop bragging.

268
00:31:44,798 --> 00:31:48,771
- Visit them for weapons.
- Kiri!

269
00:31:48,795 --> 00:31:51,773
Take it easy.

270
00:31:51,797 --> 00:31:53,796
Shut up!

271
00:31:54,777 --> 00:31:56,790
What do we have here?

272
00:32:05,784 --> 00:32:10,781
Look, Colonel. Four
fingers. It's a half-breed.

273
00:32:17,798 --> 00:32:21,778
Show me your fingers.

274
00:32:25,777 --> 00:32:27,788
You're his, aren't you?

275
00:32:29,794 --> 00:32:32,790
Yes, you are his.

276
00:32:37,797 --> 00:32:40,772
Where is he?

277
00:32:40,796 --> 00:32:43,761
Unfortunately I
don't speak English -

278
00:32:43,785 --> 00:32:45,765
- with assholes.

279
00:32:45,789 --> 00:32:48,798
Where is your father?

280
00:32:53,783 --> 00:32:55,796
Should it be with it on?

281
00:32:57,785 --> 00:32:58,793
Shut up!

282
00:33:01,798 --> 00:33:06,782
- Kiri! No, don't!
- You don't touch her!

283
00:33:07,795 --> 00:33:09,795
You mustn't hurt her.

284
00:33:11,781 --> 00:33:14,797
- Stand still.
- What's your name, kid?

285
00:33:16,789 --> 00:33:20,778
Spider Socorro.

286
00:33:28,784 --> 00:33:30,781
Miles?

287
00:33:33,777 --> 00:33:35,781
Nobody calls me that.

288
00:33:37,783 --> 00:33:42,794
It was hell. I assumed you
had been sent back to Earth.

289
00:33:44,779 --> 00:33:47,794
Children cannot
tolerate cryo, clap hat.

290
00:33:53,790 --> 00:33:55,778
What do we do, boss?

291
00:33:57,791 --> 00:34:00,779
Iron Sky, Blue 1 here.

292
00:34:04,781 --> 00:34:08,779
- Blue 1, come forward.
- We are ready for collection.

293
00:34:09,779 --> 00:34:14,756
- Fly us in.
- Dragonfly begins collection.

294
00:34:14,780 --> 00:34:17,765
We bring very
valuable prisoners.

295
00:34:17,789 --> 00:34:21,773
- Blue 1, we're on our way.
- Arrival in ten.

296
00:34:21,797 --> 00:34:23,797
We're counting down.

297
00:34:28,784 --> 00:34:31,785
Lyle, get me sound on this one.

298
00:34:34,788 --> 00:34:38,774
- It's Sully's wife.
- She's a wild animal.

299
00:34:38,798 --> 00:34:41,761
Giv op, Quaritch.

300
00:34:41,785 --> 00:34:44,784
- Sully. - Stupid pig.

301
00:34:45,791 --> 00:34:48,765
It's not over as long
as I'm breathing.

302
00:34:48,789 --> 00:34:50,797
I was hoping you would say that.

303
00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:12,756
- You stay with the Iranians.
- But I'm a warrior like you.

304
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:13,798
I won't say it again.

305
00:35:15,794 --> 00:35:17,782
Bleach.

306
00:35:39,789 --> 00:35:42,784
There is no more after that.

307
00:35:54,792 --> 00:35:57,782
Should we salvage the remains?

308
00:36:23,777 --> 00:36:25,797
Blue 1, we'll be there
in three minutes.

309
00:36:26,777 --> 00:36:28,781
Three minutes.

310
00:36:43,786 --> 00:36:44,798
Cover our backs.

311
00:37:33,786 --> 00:37:34,786
Shut up!

312
00:37:49,781 --> 00:37:50,781
Then clap in!

313
00:37:52,781 --> 00:37:54,790
Skirmish in the rear!

314
00:37:58,777 --> 00:37:59,779
Lo'ak!

315
00:38:03,798 --> 00:38:05,768
You little shit!

316
00:38:05,792 --> 00:38:08,793
- Tuck, come on! - Race!

317
00:38:16,787 --> 00:38:18,768
Come along!

318
00:38:18,792 --> 00:38:20,784
In cover!

319
00:38:23,788 --> 00:38:24,792
Come now!

320
00:38:39,789 --> 00:38:45,783
Is that you, Mrs. Sully? I
recognize your business card.

321
00:38:54,797 --> 00:39:01,788
Come forward freely, Mrs. Sully. The
two of us have an unfinished business.

322
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:10,780
Demon! I will kill you as
many times as it takes.

323
00:39:11,786 --> 00:39:15,774
You and the corporal have been
really diligent, haven't you?

324
00:39:15,798 --> 00:39:20,796
You have raised a
litter of half-breeds.

325
00:39:28,794 --> 00:39:30,787
After' four!

326
00:39:32,794 --> 00:39:35,777
Run, run, run!

327
00:39:36,781 --> 00:39:40,789
Are you okay, kid?
Follow me. Clear?

328
00:39:43,776 --> 00:39:44,783
Not!

329
00:39:48,785 --> 00:39:49,789
Come on!

330
00:39:58,782 --> 00:40:01,784
- Run, run, run! - After them!

331
00:40:08,782 --> 00:40:09,791
Spider?

332
00:40:13,777 --> 00:40:16,760
- Spider! - Kiri!

333
00:40:16,784 --> 00:40:18,758
Come here!

334
00:40:18,782 --> 00:40:20,798
Spider is down there!

335
00:40:26,782 --> 00:40:31,790
- Then we are ahead. We have ten minutes.
- Blue 1, back to the collection point.

336
00:40:39,784 --> 00:40:41,798
- Blue 1, fall back. - Back!

337
00:40:42,779 --> 00:40:44,798
Back, back! Take off!

338
00:40:47,781 --> 00:40:51,757
Kiri, come on! Come on!

339
00:40:51,781 --> 00:40:53,785
Run, run, run!

340
00:40:55,780 --> 00:40:57,772
- Are you hurt? - No, I'm fine.

341
00:40:57,796 --> 00:40:59,794
Tuk, are you hurt?

342
00:41:18,792 --> 00:41:21,768
Then the danger is over.
Is everyone unharmed?

343
00:41:21,792 --> 00:41:23,787
Tuk!

344
00:41:26,780 --> 00:41:28,764
We made it.

345
00:41:28,788 --> 00:41:32,798
Thank you, All
courage is, thank you.

346
00:41:33,779 --> 00:41:35,763
Where is Spider?

347
00:41:35,787 --> 00:41:39,771
They took him. They took him.

348
00:41:39,795 --> 00:41:44,783
Take it easy, honey.
He's a cool kid.

349
00:41:46,781 --> 00:41:48,797
He'll probably make it.

350
00:41:49,777 --> 00:41:52,776
We'll probably make
it all together.

351
00:42:01,109 --> 00:42:02,127
Before hell!

352
00:42:07,116 --> 00:42:08,125
Let me out!

353
00:42:16,129 --> 00:42:21,120
He has become like a savage.
He thinks he is one of them.

354
00:42:24,123 --> 00:42:29,131
The Quaritch creature can wade in
here without Eywa spotting him.

355
00:42:30,112 --> 00:42:34,098
- Our home is here.
- This applies to our children.

356
00:42:34,122 --> 00:42:37,117
You can't ask me for that.

357
00:42:39,115 --> 00:42:43,096
I cannot leave my
people. I will not.

358
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:47,099
He's chasing us. He's
after our family.

359
00:42:47,123 --> 00:42:53,129
You can't ask me for that. The children
only know the forest. Our home is here!

360
00:42:54,109 --> 00:42:58,121
He had our children. He
had them under his knife.

361
00:43:04,118 --> 00:43:08,094
My father gave me the bow
here when he was dying.

362
00:43:08,118 --> 00:43:14,097
He told me to protect the
people. You are toruk makto!

363
00:43:14,121 --> 00:43:19,098
This will protect the people. Quaritch
has Spider and he knows everything.

364
00:43:19,122 --> 00:43:22,103
He can lead them right here.

365
00:43:22,127 --> 00:43:26,099
If the people hide us,
they will be killed.

366
00:43:26,123 --> 00:43:28,131
Do you understand that?

367
00:43:32,118 --> 00:43:36,126
I have nothing. I
don't have any plan.

368
00:43:38,117 --> 00:43:41,128
But I can protect our family.

369
00:43:55,111 --> 00:43:56,127
One thing I know.

370
00:43:59,128 --> 00:44:04,114
Wherever we are,
family is our fortress.

371
00:44:16,128 --> 00:44:20,117
- Where's Jake Sully?
- I do not know!

372
00:44:21,118 --> 00:44:24,102
- We know, you know.
- I do not know!

373
00:44:24,126 --> 00:44:28,117
Form a picture in your mind. Does
it represent the floating mountains?

374
00:44:29,118 --> 00:44:32,131
- Release me!
- He bristles against.

375
00:44:33,111 --> 00:44:36,101
Dan a thought, and we'll see.

376
00:44:36,125 --> 00:44:41,096
- I do not know!
- I don't enjoy this either.

377
00:44:41,120 --> 00:44:46,112
- Which clans protect him?
- I have no idea!

378
00:44:47,124 --> 00:44:49,131
The forehead patch
goes absolutely crazy.

379
00:44:50,112 --> 00:44:54,096
It won't stop until you
tell us where he is.

380
00:44:54,120 --> 00:44:57,127
I don't know, you assholes!

381
00:45:11,112 --> 00:45:14,124
Let me try the personal angle.

382
00:45:18,112 --> 00:45:20,124
He is not your son.

383
00:45:51,109 --> 00:45:53,110
Funny, Tarzan, funny.

384
00:46:02,109 --> 00:46:04,111
Are you calm?

385
00:46:09,124 --> 00:46:15,093
You're cool, kid. The researchers
gave you the rough file, -

386
00:46:15,117 --> 00:46:18,131
- but you didn't
reveal anything.

387
00:46:19,111 --> 00:46:22,118
I respect that.

388
00:46:26,112 --> 00:46:28,125
Maybe you want this.

389
00:46:36,112 --> 00:46:39,098
This is Colonel Miles
Quaritch. Deceased.

390
00:46:39,122 --> 00:46:42,113
The decline in service.

391
00:46:47,109 --> 00:46:49,104
I'm not him.

392
00:46:49,128 --> 00:46:53,128
But I have his memories.

393
00:46:56,124 --> 00:46:59,101
And they tell me, -

394
00:46:59,125 --> 00:47:02,104
- that he wasn't the
world's best father.

395
00:47:02,128 --> 00:47:05,100
But that is not an excuse.

396
00:47:05,124 --> 00:47:10,131
I'm not your father. Technically,
the two of us are not related.

397
00:47:11,112 --> 00:47:16,131
But I can help you. I
can get you out of here.

398
00:47:21,109 --> 00:47:26,105
I won't ask you to betray Jake Sully.
You would never do that. You are loyal.

399
00:47:26,129 --> 00:47:30,097
And I admire loyalty.

400
00:47:30,121 --> 00:47:33,111
Now just take it.

401
00:47:34,127 --> 00:47:37,123
Otherwise I must leave
you to the coattails.

402
00:47:46,130 --> 00:47:49,131
My heart is heavy as stone.

403
00:47:50,111 --> 00:47:55,110
Tarsem is young but wise. He
will become a strong olo'eyktan.

404
00:47:57,113 --> 00:47:59,121
The leader must die...

405
00:48:03,123 --> 00:48:06,119
so that the leader can be born.

406
00:48:07,131 --> 00:48:10,125
Toruk makto will disappear.

407
00:48:12,122 --> 00:48:15,130
The people will be
able to know for sure.

408
00:48:40,131 --> 00:48:45,131
A father protects. That
is his purpose in life.

409
00:48:50,109 --> 00:48:52,099
One life ends.

410
00:48:52,123 --> 00:48:54,130
Another begins.

411
00:49:07,126 --> 00:49:09,120
Oh, Tuk...

412
00:49:13,111 --> 00:49:18,097
The sea clans inhabit a world of
their own. Thousands of islands.

413
00:49:18,121 --> 00:49:23,093
An unknown area where we will be
able to disappear without a trace.

414
00:49:23,117 --> 00:49:25,131
Aren't we there soon?

415
00:49:50,115 --> 00:49:53,120
AWA'ATLU, IN METKAYINA-LANDSBY

416
00:50:30,128 --> 00:50:33,115
Let it stay.

417
00:50:34,117 --> 00:50:36,111
Follow me.

418
00:50:37,121 --> 00:50:38,121
Tuk.

419
00:50:40,109 --> 00:50:41,127
Behave nicely.

420
00:50:42,123 --> 00:50:44,117
Behave nicely.

421
00:51:04,110 --> 00:51:06,089
Take it easy.

422
00:51:06,113 --> 00:51:09,116
What is it? Should
it represent a tail?

423
00:51:26,131 --> 00:51:29,093
It is then too
small to swim with.

424
00:51:29,117 --> 00:51:32,117
Hang on, Rotxo and Ao'nung.

425
00:51:34,112 --> 00:51:35,117
Hi.

426
00:52:00,116 --> 00:52:05,093
Tonowari was chief of the
Metkayina, the reef people.

427
00:52:05,117 --> 00:52:08,130
- I see you, Tonowari.
- Jake Sully.

428
00:52:09,110 --> 00:52:12,118
He was known as a harsh leader.

429
00:52:15,114 --> 00:52:18,126
But it wasn't Tonowari
that worried me.

430
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:24,100
I see you, Ron al, the
tsahik of the metkayinas.

431
00:52:24,124 --> 00:52:26,119
I see you, Ron al.

432
00:52:28,109 --> 00:52:32,097
- What do you want from us, Jake Sully?
- We are looking for a trip...

433
00:52:32,121 --> 00:52:36,112
- Uturu? - Asylum for my family.

434
00:52:39,117 --> 00:52:44,102
We are reef people. You are forest
people. Your skills cannot be used here.

435
00:52:44,126 --> 00:52:48,120
So we want to get to
know yours, right?

436
00:52:51,121 --> 00:52:53,117
Their arms are thin.

437
00:52:54,124 --> 00:52:59,126
Their tails are weak. You
will be slow in the water.

438
00:53:02,115 --> 00:53:05,120
The kids aren't even true Na'vi.

439
00:53:07,121 --> 00:53:09,109
Yes, we are.

440
00:53:12,112 --> 00:53:13,272
There is demon blood in them!

441
00:53:18,124 --> 00:53:19,130
Se her.

442
00:53:21,124 --> 00:53:25,131
I was born of the sky people and
now I am na'vi. You can adapt.

443
00:53:26,111 --> 00:53:29,098
We will adapt.

444
00:53:29,122 --> 00:53:32,116
My husband was toruk makto.

445
00:53:33,121 --> 00:53:39,110
He led the clans to victory
over the Sky People.

446
00:53:41,117 --> 00:53:45,116
Do you call it a victory
to hide among strangers?

447
00:53:49,125 --> 00:53:53,117
Eywa has apparently turned her
back on you, you chosen one.

448
00:53:59,121 --> 00:54:05,109
You must bear with my mate. She has
flown a long way and is exhausted.

449
00:54:10,117 --> 00:54:16,099
Toruk makto is a mighty war
hero. All Na'vi know his story.

450
00:54:16,123 --> 00:54:20,115
But we Metkayina are not at war.

451
00:54:22,119 --> 00:54:25,093
We can't let you
take the war here.

452
00:54:25,117 --> 00:54:28,096
I'm done with war, okay?

453
00:54:28,120 --> 00:54:32,120
I just want to
protect my family.

454
00:54:35,118 --> 00:54:38,112
We have asked for an outing...

455
00:54:42,116 --> 00:54:45,112
- Will we be sent away?
- It will be OK.

456
00:54:57,131 --> 00:55:01,101
Toruk makto and his
family stay with us.

457
00:55:01,125 --> 00:55:07,113
Consider them our brothers and
sisters. But they don't know the sea.

458
00:55:08,112 --> 00:55:13,093
Therefore, they will be like
newborns taking their first breath.

459
00:55:13,117 --> 00:55:18,129
Teach them about our way of life so that they
will not suffer the shame of being useless.

460
00:55:21,113 --> 00:55:24,097
- What do you say then?
- Thanks.

461
00:55:24,121 --> 00:55:25,130
So.

462
00:55:26,110 --> 00:55:29,131
My son Ao'nung and daughter
Tsireya will guide your children.

463
00:55:30,111 --> 00:55:32,099
- Why? - It has been decided.

464
00:55:32,123 --> 00:55:35,113
Come and see our village.

465
00:55:45,123 --> 00:55:46,126
This way.

466
00:55:50,112 --> 00:55:51,103
Come on now, Tuk.

467
00:55:51,127 --> 00:55:53,130
It's right up here.

468
00:56:01,129 --> 00:56:05,112
This is your new home.

469
00:56:06,111 --> 00:56:08,090
It's possible.

470
00:56:08,114 --> 00:56:11,109
That's cool, huh?

471
00:56:23,702 --> 00:56:26,683
- Sully is, step up.
- There is a family meeting.

472
00:56:26,707 --> 00:56:28,686
- Down on your knees. - Kiri.

473
00:56:28,710 --> 00:56:30,714
What?

474
00:56:32,691 --> 00:56:37,674
I need you to behave in an
exemplary manner. I mean it.

475
00:56:37,698 --> 00:56:42,672
Learn quickly, take your turn, and
avoid making trouble. Understood?

476
00:56:42,696 --> 00:56:44,693
Bleach.

477
00:56:45,714 --> 00:56:49,684
I want to go home.

478
00:56:49,708 --> 00:56:51,677
Oh, Tuk...

479
00:56:51,701 --> 00:56:55,696
Tuk, this is our home now.

480
00:56:56,708 --> 00:57:00,674
We'll probably make it.

481
00:57:00,698 --> 00:57:05,690
- As long as we look after each other.
- What is it that dad always says?

482
00:57:05,714 --> 00:57:08,681
Sully is a stickler.

483
00:57:08,705 --> 00:57:12,703
Yes, Sully is a stickler.
Then say it with conviction.

484
00:57:14,696 --> 00:57:18,698
- Sully is a stickler.
- Sully is a stickler.

485
00:57:29,691 --> 00:57:30,701
Come on!

486
00:59:07,702 --> 00:59:09,695
Swim with us.

487
00:59:43,707 --> 00:59:48,671
- What's wrong with them?
- They are bad at diving.

488
00:59:48,695 --> 00:59:51,703
Stop. They just
have to learn it.

489
01:00:01,714 --> 01:00:06,684
- Are you okay?
- You swim far too fast.

490
01:00:06,708 --> 01:00:08,713
Just breathe.

491
01:00:09,693 --> 01:00:13,684
You are not good at diving. You are
probably better at swinging in the trees.

492
01:00:13,708 --> 01:00:17,712
- Stop it.
- We don't understand your sign language.

493
01:00:18,691 --> 01:00:21,684
- I'll probably teach you that.
- Where has Kiri gone?

494
01:00:21,708 --> 01:00:24,707
- Where is she?
- Have you seen her?

495
01:00:35,708 --> 01:00:40,672
Hop on board, find a seat,
and don't get in the way.

496
01:00:40,696 --> 01:00:44,674
- Come on, hurry up! - Coolest.

497
01:00:44,698 --> 01:00:47,681
Stop halfway, Karl Smart.

498
01:00:47,705 --> 01:00:52,672
Listen. There is a transmitter
built into the mask.

499
01:00:52,696 --> 01:00:56,684
If you run away, I'll catch
you at zero point five -

500
01:00:56,708 --> 01:01:01,681
- and gives you an old-fashioned
finish. Understood?

501
01:01:01,705 --> 01:01:04,679
- Understood? - Yes.

502
01:01:04,703 --> 01:01:06,712
- Clear? - All clear.

503
01:01:21,703 --> 01:01:26,674
Listen carefully. Jake
Sully has gone underground.

504
01:01:26,698 --> 01:01:32,693
But we'll probably find
him and his crazy madame.

505
01:01:33,710 --> 01:01:37,681
To be able to do that,
we must be na'vi.

506
01:01:37,705 --> 01:01:39,683
Too full screw.

507
01:01:39,707 --> 01:01:45,679
We must eat like the Na'vi, ride like
the Na'vi and think like the Na'vi.

508
01:01:45,703 --> 01:01:50,712
And first of all,
we must speak Na'vi.

509
01:01:53,702 --> 01:01:58,700
Do you call that speaking na'vi?
You sound like a three year old.

510
01:02:00,714 --> 01:02:02,713
Okay, klogeåge.

511
01:02:03,693 --> 01:02:07,703
You've just been promoted from our
monkey mascot to our interpreter.

512
01:02:14,703 --> 01:02:19,700
It's an illusion. If you want to
live here, you must be able to ride.

513
01:02:20,708 --> 01:02:23,703
Tie the ribbon carefully.

514
01:02:27,698 --> 01:02:31,698
Feel his breath.
Feel his strength.

515
01:02:32,703 --> 01:02:34,689
Hold fast her.

516
01:02:34,713 --> 01:02:38,696
- Look at his legs.
- Hold tight.

517
01:02:57,693 --> 01:02:59,691
Everything okay, wood goblin?

518
01:03:09,693 --> 01:03:15,713
This warwalker is difficult to master.
Maybe you should start with an il...

519
01:03:16,693 --> 01:03:18,696
No, this one.

520
01:03:20,713 --> 01:03:26,693
Remember, when diving, it is
important to take the right position.

521
01:03:30,700 --> 01:03:32,700
I can do it.

522
01:03:57,698 --> 01:03:58,705
Yes like that.

523
01:03:59,713 --> 01:04:01,701
Calm.

524
01:04:47,691 --> 01:04:49,691
I love her already.

525
01:05:28,712 --> 01:05:31,695
Breathe in…

526
01:05:33,703 --> 01:05:36,672
and exhale.

527
01:05:36,696 --> 01:05:40,676
Imagine breathing into a flame.

528
01:05:40,700 --> 01:05:43,700
You must say your heartbeat.

529
01:05:44,714 --> 01:05:47,674
Breathe in.

530
01:05:47,698 --> 01:05:50,689
Breathe all the way down here.

531
01:05:50,713 --> 01:05:54,695
And exhale slowly.

532
01:05:55,693 --> 01:06:00,681
Lo'ak, your heart beats
fast. Try to concentrate.

533
01:06:00,705 --> 01:06:02,712
Breathe in…

534
01:06:03,691 --> 01:06:07,710
and exhale. Empty your mind.

535
01:06:25,696 --> 01:06:27,698
You are learning to breathe.

536
01:06:33,162 --> 01:06:35,157
Come on, losers!

537
01:06:49,173 --> 01:06:51,173
Let me.

538
01:06:56,173 --> 01:06:58,148
What is it?

539
01:06:58,172 --> 01:07:03,149
Na'vi children do this
with their bare fists.

540
01:07:03,173 --> 01:07:07,171
- Did Sully do it the hard way?
- What do you think?

541
01:07:11,162 --> 01:07:12,162
What do we do?

542
01:07:16,165 --> 01:07:19,155
This is going to be good.

543
01:07:22,151 --> 01:07:23,158
Forward.

544
01:07:30,167 --> 01:07:32,164
It's you and me, baby.

545
01:07:45,169 --> 01:07:48,173
Did I say you have to tie
the beak together first?

546
01:07:49,153 --> 01:07:50,170
Ih, tak!

547
01:07:55,156 --> 01:07:56,173
Forward!

548
01:08:03,170 --> 01:08:05,157
Can you see them?

549
01:08:27,166 --> 01:08:31,151
Come on, we have to move on.

550
01:08:33,152 --> 01:08:34,165
Take off.

551
01:08:41,156 --> 01:08:43,166
Yes, because!

552
01:08:46,150 --> 01:08:47,162
That's right, Colonel!

553
01:08:48,170 --> 01:08:51,154
Whose turn is it then?

554
01:08:58,169 --> 01:09:03,156
The being of water has
no beginning and no end.

555
01:09:07,151 --> 01:09:11,163
The sea is around
you and in you.

556
01:09:16,173 --> 01:09:21,169
The sea is your home
before your birth...

557
01:09:22,170 --> 01:09:25,167
and after your death.

558
01:09:30,159 --> 01:09:33,171
Our hearts beat in
the lap of the world.

559
01:09:36,160 --> 01:09:40,166
Our breath burns in the
shadows of the deep.

560
01:09:42,152 --> 01:09:47,152
The sea gives and the sea takes.

561
01:09:50,152 --> 01:09:52,172
Water ties everything together.

562
01:09:55,154 --> 01:09:57,165
Life and death.

563
01:09:59,162 --> 01:10:02,164
The dark and the light.

564
01:10:04,170 --> 01:10:08,164
- I got it! Tsireya!
- You did it.

565
01:10:24,161 --> 01:10:27,164
They let us breathe underwater.

566
01:11:10,167 --> 01:11:12,139
What is she doing?

567
01:11:12,163 --> 01:11:16,157
- Have no idea.
- She just stares at the sand.

568
01:11:17,172 --> 01:11:19,130
What did you say?

569
01:11:19,154 --> 01:11:22,148
Are you a form of deformity?

570
01:11:22,172 --> 01:11:25,150
Are you a deformity?

571
01:11:27,167 --> 01:11:28,171
No.

572
01:11:29,154 --> 01:11:32,143
Are you sure? You
are not a real na'vi.

573
01:11:32,167 --> 01:11:35,159
Look at those hands. See.

574
01:11:37,159 --> 01:11:39,138
Skrid, fish face.

575
01:11:39,162 --> 01:11:44,148
- Another four-fingered deformity.
- Look at his little baby tail.

576
01:11:44,172 --> 01:11:47,146
- Let us be! - He's not normal.

577
01:11:47,170 --> 01:11:51,154
Look at his tail.
It is very cute.

578
01:11:52,159 --> 01:11:55,143
You heard her. Leave them alone.

579
01:11:55,167 --> 01:11:58,130
Big Brother...

580
01:11:58,154 --> 01:12:02,151
Step with you. Now.

581
01:12:07,173 --> 01:12:14,157
Sensible. And from now on,
please respect my sister.

582
01:12:17,170 --> 01:12:19,162
Come on.

583
01:12:21,159 --> 01:12:23,137
Farewell!

584
01:12:23,161 --> 01:12:27,161
They are deformities,
the whole family.

585
01:12:28,173 --> 01:12:31,169
- Lo'ak... - Calm down bro.

586
01:12:34,162 --> 01:12:38,171
Yes, my hand is weird.
I am a deformity.

587
01:12:40,158 --> 01:12:45,147
But it can do something cool.
First I tie it really tight.

588
01:12:45,171 --> 01:12:47,158
And then…

589
01:12:51,158 --> 01:12:55,157
It's called a stroke, weakling. You
will never touch my sister again.

590
01:13:06,167 --> 01:13:08,149
Hold on!

591
01:13:08,173 --> 01:13:10,166
Stop it!

592
01:13:12,155 --> 01:13:14,154
That's too stupid!

593
01:13:16,173 --> 01:13:19,140
Off, my tail!

594
01:13:19,164 --> 01:13:24,172
My ear! Let it go!
He rips my ear!

595
01:13:29,153 --> 01:13:33,131
- What had I asked you?
- To avoid making trouble.

596
01:13:33,155 --> 01:13:36,147
- It was my fault.
- You must not take out the rubbish for him.

597
01:13:36,171 --> 01:13:40,157
Ao'nung called Kiri a deformity.

598
01:13:44,161 --> 01:13:49,153
Say sorry to Ao'nung.
He is the chief's son.

599
01:13:50,159 --> 01:13:54,159
I don't care how, as long
as you make peace with him.

600
01:14:01,164 --> 01:14:04,164
- What did the others look like?
- Worse.

601
01:14:05,158 --> 01:14:07,170
- Well. - Much worse.

602
01:14:08,150 --> 01:14:09,165
Go away.

603
01:14:21,155 --> 01:14:23,172
What's wrong?

604
01:14:24,152 --> 01:14:28,169
Nothing. I'm fine.
Why shouldn't I?

605
01:14:36,156 --> 01:14:40,142
Why can't I just be
like everyone else?

606
01:14:40,166 --> 01:14:42,166
Skin...

607
01:14:45,161 --> 01:14:48,170
What is the tree
runner doing here?

608
01:14:51,153 --> 01:14:54,154
Sorry, I hit you a
whole bunch of times.

609
01:15:00,169 --> 01:15:03,163
Let's be friends.

610
01:15:04,171 --> 01:15:09,173
Join us on a hunt outside the
reef. This is where the men hunt.

611
01:15:11,153 --> 01:15:15,153
- I must not.
- I asked the wrong brother.

612
01:15:16,159 --> 01:15:18,157
Let's do it.

613
01:15:32,157 --> 01:15:33,173
Come on!

614
01:15:43,160 --> 01:15:45,153
Stay tuned, forest troll!

615
01:15:49,151 --> 01:15:53,158
THE WOODEN BREAD CUTTERS

616
01:16:00,162 --> 01:16:04,150
- You survived.
- It was awesome!

617
01:16:05,156 --> 01:16:07,172
Come on, I know a good place.

618
01:16:20,156 --> 01:16:21,170
Cold on the fish.

619
01:16:37,172 --> 01:16:39,156
What a fool.

620
01:16:59,166 --> 01:17:02,160
Gutter?

621
01:17:05,150 --> 01:17:07,139
Yes!

622
01:17:07,163 --> 01:17:09,167
It's not funny!

623
01:17:21,112 --> 01:17:22,123
Yes!

624
01:20:56,120 --> 01:20:57,131
Holy shit.

625
01:21:27,112 --> 01:21:29,125
You are a tulkun.

626
01:21:31,130 --> 01:21:34,121
You saved my life. Thanks.

627
01:21:36,109 --> 01:21:37,123
So.

628
01:21:43,129 --> 01:21:46,115
I have no idea what you said.

629
01:21:52,123 --> 01:21:54,115
They have done you harm.

630
01:21:56,123 --> 01:21:59,099
I try to pull it out.

631
01:21:59,123 --> 01:22:01,127
Trust me.

632
01:22:35,127 --> 01:22:37,114
Friends?

633
01:22:40,118 --> 01:22:43,115
Yes, we are friends.

634
01:22:47,120 --> 01:22:48,124
Bro!

635
01:23:59,114 --> 01:24:01,126
I am sorry.

636
01:24:40,112 --> 01:24:44,127
What's the matter, honey?
Do you miss Spider?

637
01:24:47,124 --> 01:24:51,112
Yes, but it's not.

638
01:24:53,122 --> 01:24:58,092
Okay. What is it then?

639
01:24:58,116 --> 01:25:02,099
I can feel her, Dad.

640
01:25:02,123 --> 01:25:05,115
- Mark who? - Eywa.

641
01:25:10,110 --> 01:25:15,106
I can hear her breathing.
I can hear her heartbeat.

642
01:25:15,130 --> 01:25:18,097
She is so close.

643
01:25:18,121 --> 01:25:20,129
She is present...

644
01:25:22,125 --> 01:25:25,125
like a word that is
right on the tongue.

645
01:25:30,119 --> 01:25:33,118
I know you think I'm crazy.

646
01:25:34,131 --> 01:25:36,131
You're not crazy, honey.

647
01:25:41,119 --> 01:25:43,125
So what does Eywa's
heartbeat sound like?

648
01:25:48,129 --> 01:25:51,118
Powerful.

649
01:25:57,129 --> 01:26:00,119
Tell him what you told me.

650
01:26:05,111 --> 01:26:07,131
Do you like stargazing?

651
01:26:10,109 --> 01:26:12,110
My father came from a star.

652
01:26:13,116 --> 01:26:15,128
The one right there.

653
01:26:18,122 --> 01:26:21,114
- Lo'ak! - Now I'm on it.

654
01:26:24,114 --> 01:26:25,130
We will meet again.

655
01:26:44,126 --> 01:26:48,117
- The boy has been found!
- The Sully boy has been found!

656
01:26:57,119 --> 01:26:59,106
Let me see you.

657
01:26:59,130 --> 01:27:04,111
He is unharmed. It's
just a few scratches.

658
01:27:06,122 --> 01:27:10,129
Give me strength not to
tear my eyes out at my son.

659
01:27:12,109 --> 01:27:16,122
No. My son knew not to
take him outside the reef.

660
01:27:18,115 --> 01:27:19,130
The fault is his.

661
01:27:21,115 --> 01:27:22,103
Come on.

662
01:27:22,127 --> 01:27:27,129
No. It's not Ao'nung's
fault. It was my idea.

663
01:27:28,109 --> 01:27:32,109
Ao'nung actually tried
to talk me out of it.

664
01:27:33,112 --> 01:27:36,089
- Lo'ak. - Pardon.

665
01:27:36,113 --> 01:27:38,111
Come on.

666
01:27:40,112 --> 01:27:42,108
I will probably.

667
01:27:44,118 --> 01:27:48,109
- Is it true?
- What were you thinking?

668
01:27:51,117 --> 01:27:54,095
You yourself said I should
be friends with them.

669
01:27:54,119 --> 01:27:59,111
I don't want to hear about it. You
have brought shame on the family.

670
01:28:01,111 --> 01:28:04,130
- Can I leave now?
- Next time I'll tie a knot in your tail.

671
01:28:05,110 --> 01:28:09,125
- Is that understood?
- Yes. Lima Charlie.

672
01:28:18,124 --> 01:28:23,098
- Where were you?
- You should keep an eye on your brother.

673
01:28:23,122 --> 01:28:25,122
Pardon.

674
01:28:29,127 --> 01:28:31,130
Why did you speak for me?

675
01:28:32,110 --> 01:28:36,115
Because I know what it's like
to be one big disappointment.

676
01:28:38,114 --> 01:28:42,095
Wish I had been there.
The sea gave you a gift.

677
01:28:42,119 --> 01:28:48,092
The tulkuns have not come yet,
and no tulkun swims alone.

678
01:28:48,116 --> 01:28:50,093
It did here.

679
01:28:50,117 --> 01:28:55,102
He was missing his one fin.
The left one was only a stump.

680
01:28:55,126 --> 01:28:58,106
Payakan. Det er Payakan.

681
01:28:58,130 --> 01:29:02,094
- Who is Payakan?
- A young, unruly bull.

682
01:29:02,118 --> 01:29:05,106
He is outcast and missing a fin.

683
01:29:05,130 --> 01:29:12,093
- He was supposed to be a killer.
- He has killed Na'vi and Tulkuns.

684
01:29:12,117 --> 01:29:16,124
- Far down south.
- He's not a killer.

685
01:29:17,125 --> 01:29:21,104
- You're lucky you survived.
- Well, he saved my life.

686
01:29:21,128 --> 01:29:25,103
- He is my friend.
- My little brother...

687
01:29:25,127 --> 01:29:30,118
The mighty warrior who fought
a killer tulkun and survived.

688
01:29:31,124 --> 01:29:34,093
You don't listen.

689
01:29:34,117 --> 01:29:38,111
- I'm listening.
- Lo'ak, come back.

690
01:29:39,359 --> 01:29:40,378
Payakan!

691
01:29:42,361 --> 01:29:43,376
Payakan!

692
01:29:45,368 --> 01:29:47,364
Payakan!

693
01:29:55,365 --> 01:29:57,364
Good to see you.

694
01:29:59,373 --> 01:30:02,376
Why are you outcast?
What happened?

695
01:30:03,375 --> 01:30:06,370
It's too painful.

696
01:30:07,381 --> 01:30:13,361
I trust you. You can trust me.

697
01:30:58,373 --> 01:31:00,374
Oh, that's lame.

698
01:31:04,371 --> 01:31:06,371
Faster!

699
01:31:41,377 --> 01:31:43,380
So here we are.

700
01:31:49,373 --> 01:31:54,369
The Vig of the Ancestors
is our holiest place.

701
01:32:00,366 --> 01:32:03,368
Eclipse is the best
time to be here.

702
01:32:16,377 --> 01:32:20,371
There it is. The Spirit Tree.

703
01:33:25,871 --> 01:33:28,846
My pretty daughter.

704
01:33:28,870 --> 01:33:30,845
Hi Mom.

705
01:33:30,869 --> 01:33:33,875
It's nice to see you.
But you look worried.

706
01:33:40,865 --> 01:33:43,880
Sweetie, it'll be fine.

707
01:33:51,860 --> 01:33:56,862
- What's wrong?
- Why am I different?

708
01:33:57,874 --> 01:34:00,874
What does the Almother want me?

709
01:34:03,870 --> 01:34:06,879
Who was my father?

710
01:34:09,862 --> 01:34:12,862
Oh, my own…

711
01:34:35,867 --> 01:34:37,862
- Come now! - Kiri!

712
01:34:38,875 --> 01:34:40,864
Skin!

713
01:34:42,869 --> 01:34:46,841
- What's wrong?
- She had a seizure.

714
01:34:46,865 --> 01:34:48,877
Is she breathing?

715
01:34:52,858 --> 01:34:56,866
- Get her home to the village.
- Lets go!

716
01:35:12,860 --> 01:35:15,844
- Good to see you.
- Neteyam, keep them away.

717
01:35:15,868 --> 01:35:18,838
- How is she?
- Still unconscious.

718
01:35:18,862 --> 01:35:21,850
No bleeding, no breakage.

719
01:35:21,874 --> 01:35:24,878
The lack of oxygen has
not damaged the brain.

720
01:35:29,873 --> 01:35:32,857
But there is interictal
activity in the frontal lobe.

721
01:35:32,881 --> 01:35:37,854
She must have had a seizure.
We can rule out toxins.

722
01:35:37,878 --> 01:35:42,878
- I'm not needed here.
- You are tsahik.

723
01:35:43,875 --> 01:35:47,856
- Remove the remedies.
- Out! You have done nothing!

724
01:35:47,880 --> 01:35:52,863
- Come on, we're taking a break.
- Let me just take the drop out.

725
01:35:53,866 --> 01:35:54,880
Tuktirey.

726
01:36:02,878 --> 01:36:07,846
She said she could feel
Eywa and hear her heartbeat.

727
01:36:07,870 --> 01:36:11,839
- It is typical frontal lobe epilepsy.
- Epilepsy?

728
01:36:11,863 --> 01:36:15,880
One sees visions and experiences religious
ecstasy like the one she described.

729
01:36:24,864 --> 01:36:27,852
The association with the Spirit
Tree must have triggered it.

730
01:36:27,876 --> 01:36:31,845
Don't let her do that again.

731
01:36:31,869 --> 01:36:32,880
Never?

732
01:36:33,860 --> 01:36:38,878
Jake, if she has another seizure
underwater, she could die.

733
01:36:48,869 --> 01:36:52,859
Kiri, you are awake.

734
01:37:00,877 --> 01:37:04,878
Kiri, sweet child.
My lovely girl.

735
01:37:05,858 --> 01:37:08,858
Try this one: "I see you."

736
01:37:13,876 --> 01:37:15,867
I said that too.

737
01:37:17,862 --> 01:37:19,879
I don't know. Ngaati.

738
01:37:20,880 --> 01:37:23,879
Okay, it's going out
through the nose.

739
01:37:24,859 --> 01:37:28,880
Chief, one of the patrols has detected
a helicopter gunship on the radar.

740
01:37:30,863 --> 01:37:33,862
- Where?
- Above the sea, 400 km to the north.

741
01:37:35,876 --> 01:37:37,868
Hold fast.

742
01:37:39,865 --> 01:37:43,846
The signal disappeared
out over the open sea.

743
01:37:43,870 --> 01:37:49,845
But if you continue the course,
you will hit this archipelago.

744
01:37:49,869 --> 01:37:53,878
There are hundreds of islands
with countless villages.

745
01:37:54,858 --> 01:37:59,858
It's him. Give me some vessels and
I will return home with his scalp.

746
01:38:11,860 --> 01:38:14,860
- We will be flown in.
- Skipper.

747
01:38:21,869 --> 01:38:25,858
- Stop the engines. - Yes.

748
01:38:44,879 --> 01:38:47,845
Are you Scoresby?

749
01:38:47,869 --> 01:38:50,845
Are you the badass
taking my ship?

750
01:38:50,869 --> 01:38:53,844
It is me.

751
01:38:53,868 --> 01:38:57,846
The target is the
entire archipelago.

752
01:38:57,870 --> 01:39:02,848
I've never been up there. You
know the waters. Who lives there?

753
01:39:02,872 --> 01:39:06,849
Primarily metkayinas,
about 50 villages.

754
01:39:06,873 --> 01:39:08,848
Who are you?

755
01:39:08,872 --> 01:39:13,838
Ian Garvin, marinbiolog.

756
01:39:13,862 --> 01:39:16,876
If there are 100 villages,
we search them all.

757
01:39:17,880 --> 01:39:24,863
I hunt tulkuns. That's what
we do. I have quotas to meet.

758
01:39:25,864 --> 01:39:29,875
I'm being polite the first
time. Then it's over.

759
01:39:32,861 --> 01:39:36,839
If you can't avoid
it, get into it.

760
01:39:36,863 --> 01:39:40,859
- All men at their posts!
- Hello, no pills.

761
01:39:41,869 --> 01:39:44,869
- Rudder threads, airspeed.
- Yes.

762
01:39:56,069 --> 01:40:00,081
- What was it?
- What's going on?

763
01:40:02,087 --> 01:40:07,085
The Tulkuns have returned! Our
brothers and sisters are back!

764
01:40:18,067 --> 01:40:23,067
Their endless cycle of wandering
had brought the Tulkuns home.

765
01:40:28,067 --> 01:40:29,062
Skin!

766
01:40:29,086 --> 01:40:34,066
- Kiri, come!
- Tuk, leave me alone.

767
01:40:35,082 --> 01:40:38,086
- What is it you want? - Look!

768
01:40:46,076 --> 01:40:50,053
Let's go out and meet them.

769
01:40:50,077 --> 01:40:52,086
There is my soul sister.

770
01:41:49,084 --> 01:41:52,082
Sister, I see you.

771
01:41:53,076 --> 01:41:55,089
I see you and I am happy.

772
01:42:01,089 --> 01:42:05,059
Your son is very handsome.

773
01:42:05,083 --> 01:42:08,079
Thanks. How is your little one?

774
01:42:09,077 --> 01:42:12,066
My little one is strong.

775
01:42:14,077 --> 01:42:15,087
I have met a boy.

776
01:42:16,067 --> 01:42:20,064
Now stories had to be told about
the time they had been apart.

777
01:42:20,088 --> 01:42:23,083
About death and births.

778
01:42:24,087 --> 01:42:28,070
About old friends and new love.

779
01:42:43,073 --> 01:42:46,070
TA'UNUI-LANDSBY

780
01:42:50,085 --> 01:42:52,065
Keep calm.

781
01:42:52,089 --> 01:42:56,062
We are looking for weapons,
radios, technical equipment.

782
01:42:56,086 --> 01:43:00,059
Down on your knees!
Can you see it here?

783
01:43:00,083 --> 01:43:02,071
Shut up!

784
01:43:05,071 --> 01:43:11,089
We know this man resides somewhere
here on the islands. Is he here?

785
01:43:12,069 --> 01:43:18,058
Our tribe lives in seclusion. The man
in the picture is from the forest.

786
01:43:18,082 --> 01:43:23,060
- What is he saying?
- That forest people never come here.

787
01:43:23,084 --> 01:43:26,077
I don't buy it.

788
01:43:30,082 --> 01:43:34,085
He must search in the forest
if he is to find that man.

789
01:43:37,073 --> 01:43:38,089
They know nothing.

790
01:43:41,081 --> 01:43:44,067
Shoot that animal.

791
01:43:45,088 --> 01:43:47,080
What are you doing?

792
01:43:56,083 --> 01:43:59,053
Take it easy.

793
01:43:59,077 --> 01:44:03,074
Are your ears working now? Now
you have seen what they can do.

794
01:44:05,083 --> 01:44:10,058
Jake Sully. Toruk makto!

795
01:44:10,082 --> 01:44:12,050
He knows nothing.

796
01:44:12,074 --> 01:44:14,066
Kill her.

797
01:44:16,087 --> 01:44:18,062
Stop! Stop!

798
01:44:18,086 --> 01:44:24,058
Cut it out of cardboard for him. If he
doesn't expose Sully, we'll kill the tsahik.

799
01:44:24,082 --> 01:44:29,073
No, I refuse. I don't
want to be part of this.

800
01:44:30,085 --> 01:44:33,083
They know nothing!

801
01:44:39,075 --> 01:44:41,063
Are we really going to kill her?

802
01:44:41,087 --> 01:44:47,072
You must not do that. What you
are doing here is so wrong!

803
01:44:49,066 --> 01:44:51,066
Do not.

804
01:44:54,081 --> 01:44:58,054
- Burn the cabins.
- Set them on fire.

805
01:44:58,078 --> 01:45:00,074
Set fire to it all!

806
01:45:13,066 --> 01:45:18,056
- Forgive me. I did not know it.
- You must stop the madness!

807
01:45:18,080 --> 01:45:23,047
- Forgive me. - We have slipped.

808
01:45:23,071 --> 01:45:25,089
Don't touch me!

809
01:45:26,069 --> 01:45:28,089
Come on. Sit up!

810
01:45:45,571 --> 01:45:48,565
- What's wrong? - Sky people.

811
01:45:48,589 --> 01:45:55,569
They're looking for you down south. They
have a human boy with them who speaks Na'vi.

812
01:45:59,571 --> 01:46:02,583
- Have they killed anyone?
- Not yet.

813
01:46:04,568 --> 01:46:09,584
They threaten to, but no one will
reveal where you are. On my command.

814
01:46:17,576 --> 01:46:23,562
We must hunt this demon.
Catch him and kill him.

815
01:46:23,586 --> 01:46:26,561
We have to think about it.

816
01:46:26,585 --> 01:46:33,546
If we attack Quaritch, they will
follow us here with their full force.

817
01:46:33,570 --> 01:46:36,558
So what do we do?

818
01:46:36,582 --> 01:46:41,575
We are looking for toruk
makto! Has he been here?

819
01:46:45,575 --> 01:46:48,589
- It is no use.
- They are silent as the grave.

820
01:46:49,569 --> 01:46:55,580
If we continue, he'll just run
away. We have to lure him out.

821
01:47:04,568 --> 01:47:08,557
I'm done. I have quotas to meet.

822
01:47:08,581 --> 01:47:11,586
Do you want to
hunt? Then we hunt.

823
01:47:12,566 --> 01:47:15,560
Well not here? There are
too many villages here.

824
01:47:15,584 --> 01:47:18,554
No no no.

825
01:47:18,578 --> 01:47:23,547
They do not understand the bond
of community between the Tulkuns -

826
01:47:23,571 --> 01:47:26,564
- and the Havna'vi. It would
be like murdering their family.

827
01:47:26,588 --> 01:47:30,551
If we hunt here, the
savages will come after us.

828
01:47:30,575 --> 01:47:34,587
Exactly. One definitely wild.

829
01:47:44,569 --> 01:47:47,567
I know how you feel.

830
01:47:49,568 --> 01:47:52,580
I also feel completely alone.

831
01:47:54,566 --> 01:47:58,566
Tell me. Why were you expelled?

832
01:50:19,586 --> 01:50:24,566
I am sorry. It
hurts me terribly.

833
01:50:27,571 --> 01:50:30,571
It is okay.

834
01:50:44,788 --> 01:50:47,757
You allowed it.

835
01:50:47,781 --> 01:50:51,788
You allowed him to
bond with the outcast.

836
01:50:53,797 --> 01:50:57,792
Tsireya... You
disappoint me, daughter.

837
01:50:59,777 --> 01:51:03,764
And you are the son of a great warrior.
You are better raised than that.

838
01:51:03,788 --> 01:51:08,772
Payakan saved my life.
They don't know him.

839
01:51:08,796 --> 01:51:11,758
Sit.

840
01:51:11,782 --> 01:51:13,777
Sit.

841
01:51:15,785 --> 01:51:17,785
Sit down!

842
01:51:20,796 --> 01:51:24,756
Hear my words, boy.

843
01:51:24,780 --> 01:51:29,766
In the time of the first songs, the
tulkuns fought among themselves -

844
01:51:29,790 --> 01:51:33,798
- to gain territory
and to get revenge.

845
01:51:34,778 --> 01:51:38,773
But they realized that
killing, justified or not, -

846
01:51:38,797 --> 01:51:43,761
- just leads to more killing.

847
01:51:43,785 --> 01:51:46,769
Therefore, it was
forbidden to kill.

848
01:51:46,793 --> 01:51:51,761
It is the way of
life of the tulkuns.

849
01:51:51,785 --> 01:51:57,755
Payakan is a killer and
therefore he is an outcast.

850
01:51:57,779 --> 01:52:02,758
- Sorry, but you are wrong.
- Lo'ak, you are speaking to the olo'eyktan.

851
01:52:02,782 --> 01:52:05,792
- Well... - That's good!

852
01:52:08,787 --> 01:52:10,786
I know what I know.

853
01:52:13,777 --> 01:52:15,798
Then it's good.

854
01:52:16,778 --> 01:52:18,793
I'll take care of him.

855
01:52:24,776 --> 01:52:26,796
The storm will
probably blow over.

856
01:52:27,776 --> 01:52:31,756
Lo'ak, I saw something today.

857
01:52:31,780 --> 01:52:35,756
I saw a forest boy
selected by a tulkun.

858
01:52:35,780 --> 01:52:37,773
I am very proud of you.

859
01:52:37,797 --> 01:52:41,767
It was not Payakan who
killed the boys. I saw it.

860
01:52:41,791 --> 01:52:45,765
The demon ship killed his mother,
so he gathered the young bulls -

861
01:52:45,789 --> 01:52:50,765
- and the reef boys to attack the
ship, and they were all killed.

862
01:52:50,789 --> 01:52:54,774
But of the people of heaven,
not of him. He's not a killer.

863
01:52:54,798 --> 01:52:58,770
According to the law of the Tulkuns,
he is responsible for their death.

864
01:52:58,794 --> 01:53:03,790
Will he have to pay for it for the rest of
his life? He knows what he did was wrong.

865
01:53:05,786 --> 01:53:08,796
- We have to tell my father...
- No. My father is furious.

866
01:53:09,776 --> 01:53:13,795
- Your father will understand.
- No. He doesn't understand anything.

867
01:53:14,775 --> 01:53:18,797
The whole clan hates me. Demon
blood, stranger. That's all they see.

868
01:53:25,781 --> 01:53:26,797
I see you.

869
01:53:31,781 --> 01:53:34,784
You are the brother of a tulkun.

870
01:53:36,777 --> 01:53:37,798
You are one of us now.

871
01:53:55,780 --> 01:53:59,759
- Have you found the mother?
- And the calf. 4000 meters.

872
01:53:59,783 --> 01:54:03,791
- Hull in the water!
- Yes. Carrier plan activated.

873
01:54:26,776 --> 01:54:29,760
Submarine teams, two minutes!

874
01:54:29,784 --> 01:54:32,763
Close the hatches! Hurry up!

875
01:54:32,787 --> 01:54:36,795
Crews to their boats!
Let's earn some dates.

876
01:54:38,777 --> 01:54:42,778
Folks, get off the ropes!

877
01:54:47,785 --> 01:54:49,779
The boats in the water!

878
01:54:53,796 --> 01:54:55,784
Go!

879
01:55:06,780 --> 01:55:07,794
Take off!

880
01:55:33,793 --> 01:55:37,784
Depth charges ready.
Guy, guy, guy!

881
01:55:59,793 --> 01:56:02,755
What are they doing?

882
01:56:02,779 --> 01:56:06,758
There are echolocation sensors,
with which they navigate.

883
01:56:06,782 --> 01:56:09,795
They keep them afloat
so they don't go deaf.

884
01:56:10,775 --> 01:56:14,793
Picadors, away with you!

885
01:56:30,795 --> 01:56:34,797
They isolate the cow from the
herd using the sound cannon.

886
01:56:35,777 --> 01:56:40,755
They go after the mother because the
calf is slow and she won't leave it.

887
01:56:40,779 --> 01:56:44,769
- Do they ever resist?
- No, they never lift a fin.

888
01:56:44,793 --> 01:56:50,755
But they are some sailing
devils. Submarine teams, go!

889
01:56:50,779 --> 01:56:52,781
Disconnection.

890
01:56:55,790 --> 01:56:57,782
Disconnection.

891
01:57:02,776 --> 01:57:06,762
- There we have the lady.
- Target in sight. Harpoons ready.

892
01:57:06,786 --> 01:57:08,796
Then we go to it.

893
01:57:09,776 --> 01:57:13,784
We attack from below, where
their armor has cracks.

894
01:57:16,789 --> 01:57:20,798
- Okay, that's it now.
- Get me really close.

895
01:57:24,781 --> 01:57:27,760
- Hold it steady.
- Arm the eater.

896
01:57:27,784 --> 01:57:30,783
- Armed. - Fires the eater.

897
01:57:37,777 --> 01:57:40,786
2 ready. Arm the eater. Guy!

898
01:57:44,792 --> 01:57:47,786
- Perfect match.
- Fires the deuce.

899
01:57:48,790 --> 01:57:53,782
- Cookie!
- 3-6, you owe a bajer.

900
01:57:57,786 --> 01:58:02,764
The bags sink her and pull
her up towards the surface.

901
01:58:02,788 --> 01:58:07,772
Bring me closer! Very
close. 30 meters.

902
01:58:07,796 --> 01:58:09,798
Granatharpun.

903
01:58:10,778 --> 01:58:13,759
10 meters. Get me
all the way in there.

904
01:58:13,783 --> 01:58:18,786
Keep the boat
steady! Wait, wait.

905
01:58:20,778 --> 01:58:21,781
The line runs!

906
01:58:27,795 --> 01:58:30,780
Keep your hat and ponytail on.

907
01:58:40,797 --> 01:58:43,792
- Full power back! - Yes.

908
01:58:50,778 --> 01:58:52,795
Hold her!

909
01:58:55,795 --> 01:59:02,795
She got a grenade harpoon in the chest,
but she keeps swimming. Beautiful.

910
02:00:16,787 --> 02:00:21,774
We can only get to the gland from below,
so we drill up through the palate -

911
02:00:21,798 --> 02:00:24,792
- and into the brain.

912
02:00:27,798 --> 02:00:31,797
They are highly intelligent.
Probably smarter than us.

913
02:00:32,777 --> 02:00:35,755
- Not smarter than me.
- Then the bar is set low.

914
02:00:35,779 --> 02:00:38,757
I'm the one with the harpoon.

915
02:00:38,781 --> 02:00:39,781
And yes.

916
02:00:50,782 --> 02:00:55,760
- How do you know they are smarter than us?
- They have more neurons and nerve fibers.

917
02:00:55,784 --> 02:00:59,790
They are not only smarter,
but also deeply emotional.

918
02:01:00,785 --> 02:01:02,791
More spiritual.

919
02:01:05,787 --> 02:01:09,758
The area here corresponds
to our emotional center, -

920
02:01:09,782 --> 02:01:12,782
- but is proportionally
much larger.

921
02:01:13,781 --> 02:01:17,769
They have music,
philosophy, mathematics -

922
02:01:17,793 --> 02:01:20,759
- and a complex language.

923
02:01:20,783 --> 02:01:25,780
- Okay, that's it now.
- Bring on the horrors.

924
02:01:29,793 --> 02:01:35,775
- So it's the hops?
- In fact. Amrita.

925
02:01:37,794 --> 02:01:44,755
Unfortunately for them,
dirt can stop human aging.

926
02:01:44,779 --> 02:01:45,798
Completely.

927
02:01:47,788 --> 02:01:53,765
The most valuable raw
material known to mankind.

928
02:01:53,789 --> 02:01:59,758
This small container is worth
approximately 80 million.

929
02:01:59,782 --> 02:02:01,757
Wants!

930
02:02:01,781 --> 02:02:04,773
Do not do that.
It's never funny.

931
02:02:04,797 --> 02:02:08,796
Amrita funds everything
here on Pandora now.

932
02:02:09,792 --> 02:02:14,785
- Even your research, Dr. G.
- That's why I drink.

933
02:02:16,775 --> 02:02:20,788
Don't you take anything else?
Does the rest just go to waste?

934
02:02:21,798 --> 02:02:25,762
Empty the bags and let her sink.

935
02:02:25,786 --> 02:02:29,795
No, leave the bags alone.
They need to know it was us.

936
02:02:30,775 --> 02:02:33,796
I need extra payment
to act as bait.

937
02:03:08,775 --> 02:03:11,777
Her name is Ro'a.

938
02:03:12,792 --> 02:03:15,790
She was my soul sister.

939
02:03:18,783 --> 02:03:20,798
She composed songs.

940
02:03:21,778 --> 02:03:25,756
She was highly regarded.
We sang together.

941
02:03:25,780 --> 02:03:31,797
She waited many breeding cycles to
have a calf. The clan cheered for her.

942
02:03:35,781 --> 02:03:38,780
What's going on, Tonowari?

943
02:03:39,794 --> 02:03:42,782
What happens?

944
02:04:01,360 --> 02:04:07,358
My spirit sister and her child have
been murdered by the sky people.

945
02:04:08,368 --> 02:04:14,357
The war has come to us. We knew that
our tulkun family was being hunted, -

946
02:04:14,381 --> 02:04:19,378
- but it happened far from
here. Now this is happening!

947
02:04:23,367 --> 02:04:27,338
You have to understand
how the sky people think.

948
02:04:27,362 --> 02:04:30,351
- They don't care about the balance of life.
- They can run us!

949
02:04:30,375 --> 02:04:32,352
Now listen to him.

950
02:04:32,376 --> 02:04:38,341
This is just the beginning.
Tell the Tulkuns to flee.

951
02:04:38,365 --> 02:04:40,349
Say they must flee far away.

952
02:04:40,373 --> 02:04:42,379
Escape?

953
02:04:43,359 --> 02:04:47,338
You have lived among us, but
you have learned nothing.

954
02:04:47,362 --> 02:04:50,347
We will fight for our
brothers and sisters!

955
02:04:50,371 --> 02:04:52,369
No no no.

956
02:04:53,366 --> 02:04:57,379
If you attack them,
they will wipe you out.

957
02:04:58,359 --> 02:05:00,379
They will wipe out
everything you hold dear.

958
02:05:01,359 --> 02:05:04,352
Hear my words! Hear my words!

959
02:05:04,376 --> 02:05:07,349
Keep calm!

960
02:05:07,373 --> 02:05:11,365
Now listen to my father.
He speaks the truth.

961
02:05:20,378 --> 02:05:23,357
Tell the tulkuns, -

962
02:05:23,381 --> 02:05:28,367
- that if they are hit by such a
person, they are designated to die.

963
02:05:30,358 --> 02:05:34,343
Summon me and I'll silence it.

964
02:05:34,367 --> 02:05:38,379
Saving their lives is the only
thing that matters, right?

965
02:05:41,359 --> 02:05:43,360
To save your family.

966
02:05:55,377 --> 02:05:57,379
Notify the interpreters.

967
02:05:58,359 --> 02:06:00,380
Off, off.

968
02:06:04,368 --> 02:06:07,344
We must take up the fight.

969
02:06:07,368 --> 02:06:10,374
MaJake... I won't just stand by.

970
02:06:11,377 --> 02:06:17,375
They just want us to strike again. They
don't hunt tulkuns. They are hunting us.

971
02:06:32,364 --> 02:06:35,380
- You're not going anywhere, little brother.
- I have to warn Payakan.

972
02:06:36,360 --> 02:06:39,349
Zero. You stay here, skxawng.

973
02:06:39,373 --> 02:06:42,350
He is an outcast. No
one else will warn him.

974
02:06:42,374 --> 02:06:46,376
Bro, why do you have to make
everything so difficult?

975
02:06:48,368 --> 02:06:55,342
You mean why can't I be perfect
like you? The perfect soldier.

976
02:06:55,366 --> 02:06:59,341
I'm not you, okay?

977
02:06:59,365 --> 02:07:03,379
I'm not you. He's
my brother. I do it.

978
02:07:04,359 --> 02:07:08,352
Is he your brother?
No, I'm your brother.

979
02:07:08,376 --> 02:07:10,339
Lo'ak!

980
02:07:10,363 --> 02:07:12,345
Let go of me.

981
02:07:12,369 --> 02:07:16,365
Lo'ak! He wants
to go to Payakan.

982
02:07:28,361 --> 02:07:29,362
Come back!

983
02:07:30,368 --> 02:07:33,343
- The er Lo'ak. - Loak!

984
02:07:33,367 --> 02:07:36,363
- He wants to find Payakan.
- Wait for us.

985
02:07:37,381 --> 02:07:39,368
Hold fast.

986
02:07:47,367 --> 02:07:52,371
All men at their posts. Come,
there's money to be made!

987
02:07:59,375 --> 02:08:01,380
Payakan! Brother!

988
02:08:02,360 --> 02:08:03,360
Lo'ak!

989
02:08:05,365 --> 02:08:07,372
- Lo'ak! - Twenty!

990
02:08:10,362 --> 02:08:12,370
What's wrong?

991
02:08:13,369 --> 02:08:15,341
Shit!

992
02:08:15,365 --> 02:08:19,361
Take it easy. I remove it.

993
02:08:25,374 --> 02:08:27,359
Shit!

994
02:08:29,366 --> 02:08:30,348
Lo'ak!

995
02:08:30,372 --> 02:08:34,379
Bro, help me! The
ship is approaching!

996
02:08:37,358 --> 02:08:38,367
Come now!

997
02:08:40,372 --> 02:08:42,338
Come on bro.

998
02:08:42,362 --> 02:08:46,345
Summon father! Just do it!

999
02:08:46,369 --> 02:08:50,344
- Just do it!
- They will However, can you hear me?

1000
02:08:50,368 --> 02:08:53,347
- Did you see where they went?
- Outside the reef.

1001
02:08:53,371 --> 02:08:55,353
- Lo'ak? - Far!

1002
02:08:55,377 --> 02:08:59,381
We are with a tulkun who
is attacked by a ship.

1003
02:09:00,361 --> 02:09:03,348
- It is 2 km away.
- Who is with you?

1004
02:09:03,372 --> 02:09:06,355
All of us, at the
Three Brothers Cliffs.

1005
02:09:06,379 --> 02:09:10,381
Hide and do not attack. Is that
understood? We are on the way.

1006
02:09:11,361 --> 02:09:13,381
- Oh well.
- It's getting closer!

1007
02:09:14,361 --> 02:09:15,368
Pull!

1008
02:09:16,369 --> 02:09:21,353
The children are attacked. They defend
a tulkun. Your children are there too.

1009
02:09:21,377 --> 02:09:24,345
- Dæmonskibet? - Yes!

1010
02:09:24,369 --> 02:09:27,363
To arms! Sound the alarm!

1011
02:09:30,369 --> 02:09:33,372
- You better stay.
- I'm riding along!

1012
02:10:23,361 --> 02:10:26,370
Submarines, close the
hatches! Two minutes!

1013
02:10:33,371 --> 02:10:38,359
- Ao'nung! - Hurry up bro!

1014
02:10:40,359 --> 02:10:41,359
Quickly!

1015
02:10:45,364 --> 02:10:46,367
Pull over!

1016
02:10:48,363 --> 02:10:50,368
All at the same time!

1017
02:10:53,380 --> 02:10:57,354
It was hell. Sully's kids.

1018
02:10:57,378 --> 02:11:01,367
- Take off. Not you. - Sit up!

1019
02:11:13,363 --> 02:11:16,372
700 meters. The signal is clear.

1020
02:11:18,367 --> 02:11:21,361
- Pull up! - Pull!

1021
02:11:24,377 --> 02:11:27,350
- It came out! - Go, Tuk.

1022
02:11:27,374 --> 02:11:32,361
Off with you! The
path! I lure them away!

1023
02:11:33,375 --> 02:11:36,343
Payakan, dyk!

1024
02:11:36,367 --> 02:11:39,360
Tuk, hold fast.

1025
02:11:48,371 --> 02:11:51,350
- 300 meters.
- Depth charges ready.

1026
02:11:51,374 --> 02:11:53,380
Short, short, short!

1027
02:11:59,372 --> 02:12:04,346
No bombs. The kids are worth
nothing if they are dead.

1028
02:12:04,370 --> 02:12:06,366
The fire on hold.

1029
02:12:11,358 --> 02:12:15,355
Circle them. Launch
the submarines.

1030
02:12:15,379 --> 02:12:18,358
Submarines in the tub!

1031
02:13:07,363 --> 02:13:09,370
Crabs, turn right.

1032
02:13:13,367 --> 02:13:16,344
- They must not get away.
- The wings in!

1033
02:13:16,368 --> 02:13:18,360
Such!

1034
02:13:49,370 --> 02:13:51,362
Fires the deuce.

1035
02:14:20,378 --> 02:14:22,374
Where is Tuk?

1036
02:14:39,366 --> 02:14:40,366
Tuk!

1037
02:14:42,380 --> 02:14:43,380
Target in sight.

1038
02:14:48,363 --> 02:14:52,359
- It is coming! - We have to go.

1039
02:15:07,365 --> 02:15:09,367
Change network. Guy.

1040
02:15:29,381 --> 02:15:32,348
Hang on!

1041
02:15:32,372 --> 02:15:36,370
- Beware! Move your hand!
- Hurry up!

1042
02:15:41,359 --> 02:15:43,358
Come back!

1043
02:15:48,367 --> 02:15:51,363
- Drop your weapon! - Put it!

1044
02:15:52,371 --> 02:15:54,360
Stay there.

1045
02:15:55,359 --> 02:15:57,340
Come here, kid!

1046
02:15:57,364 --> 02:15:59,379
Put down your weapon!

1047
02:16:00,359 --> 02:16:03,338
- Put it! - Drop the knife!

1048
02:16:03,362 --> 02:16:07,341
Hello, stop! You
must not harm them!

1049
02:16:07,365 --> 02:16:08,354
Lie still!

1050
02:16:08,378 --> 02:16:13,378
- Bro, are you okay?
- I have never felt better.

1051
02:16:20,372 --> 02:16:24,340
Go back on the bridge.
Make sure he stays there!

1052
02:16:24,364 --> 02:16:26,357
I'm on my way.

1053
02:16:26,381 --> 02:16:32,379
I remember you well.
Chain them to the railing.

1054
02:16:33,376 --> 02:16:35,354
Come on!

1055
02:16:35,378 --> 02:16:39,348
- Be careful, they bite.
- Down on your knees.

1056
02:16:39,372 --> 02:16:41,368
Come with your hand.

1057
02:16:42,367 --> 02:16:44,369
And then the other.

1058
02:16:47,378 --> 02:16:49,358
Be brave.

1059
02:16:53,375 --> 02:16:54,375
After' four!

1060
02:16:57,365 --> 02:17:00,372
- Hang on! - Left flank!

1061
02:17:03,367 --> 02:17:05,368
Stop! Stop dem!

1062
02:17:07,375 --> 02:17:09,370
It's Sully.

1063
02:17:11,378 --> 02:17:13,372
300 meter.

1064
02:17:19,069 --> 02:17:23,066
They have our children.
Your daughter, Tuk, Lo'ak...

1065
02:17:26,068 --> 02:17:30,055
Jake, tell your
friends to back off.

1066
02:17:30,079 --> 02:17:35,066
If you want your children,
you will come forward alone.

1067
02:17:37,066 --> 02:17:40,074
You know not to
doubt my coolness.

1068
02:17:44,079 --> 02:17:49,048
I took you under my wing,
Jake, and you betrayed me.

1069
02:17:49,072 --> 02:17:55,085
You killed your comrades. I will
not hesitate to execute your son.

1070
02:17:57,075 --> 02:17:59,075
Now wait a bit.

1071
02:18:09,083 --> 02:18:11,062
Stay here.

1072
02:18:11,086 --> 02:18:17,056
They are interpreter killers.
They must die. Here, today.

1073
02:18:17,080 --> 02:18:23,077
They are only after me. That's why they
hunted down the Tulkuns and took our children.

1074
02:18:26,074 --> 02:18:30,083
This is your fault! Your!

1075
02:18:33,084 --> 02:18:36,077
Therefore, it is I
who must do this.

1076
02:18:41,077 --> 02:18:45,056
Offer expires soon.
What will it be?

1077
02:18:45,080 --> 02:18:49,066
Stop shooting. I am coming.

1078
02:18:59,079 --> 02:19:01,082
MaJake, what's going on?

1079
02:19:02,082 --> 02:19:04,069
MaJake?

1080
02:19:06,073 --> 02:19:09,066
Be alert, everyone.

1081
02:19:26,070 --> 02:19:30,081
- Straight to the point.
- If you shoot now, they will attack.

1082
02:19:32,066 --> 02:19:33,084
Wait until he's on board.

1083
02:20:00,078 --> 02:20:02,066
Payakan!

1084
02:20:13,084 --> 02:20:15,072
Shoot! Shoot!

1085
02:20:17,074 --> 02:20:18,085
Broder!

1086
02:20:23,068 --> 02:20:26,065
Do around! Turn me around!

1087
02:20:26,089 --> 02:20:30,081
Get me on fire! Now, now!

1088
02:20:49,074 --> 02:20:52,078
Out, quick!

1089
02:20:54,066 --> 02:20:57,076
Get me on fire!

1090
02:21:05,084 --> 02:21:07,080
Because!

1091
02:21:09,072 --> 02:21:11,070
Holy shit!

1092
02:21:15,076 --> 02:21:17,084
Give fire! Give fire!

1093
02:21:22,069 --> 02:21:24,061
Sully approaches.
Keep an eye on him.

1094
02:21:24,085 --> 02:21:27,073
Come on, sit up!

1095
02:22:08,081 --> 02:22:10,086
So shoot something!

1096
02:22:26,081 --> 02:22:27,086
Stop!

1097
02:23:23,066 --> 02:23:25,066
After them!

1098
02:23:41,077 --> 02:23:45,081
Leak! Masks on!

1099
02:24:24,086 --> 02:24:26,075
Get him out!

1100
02:24:46,076 --> 02:24:47,077
Hurry up!

1101
02:25:00,084 --> 02:25:04,050
- Damage report?
- Rooms 2 and 3 are under water.

1102
02:25:04,074 --> 02:25:06,071
Are you ok

1103
02:25:35,072 --> 02:25:39,051
- Port for the bow!
- Hard to port!

1104
02:25:39,075 --> 02:25:41,077
Get me on fire!

1105
02:25:42,081 --> 02:25:43,087
Now I have you!

1106
02:26:01,066 --> 02:26:04,051
- Get us free!
- It doesn't react.

1107
02:26:04,075 --> 02:26:08,068
- Cut the cable!
- Who has the harpoon now?

1108
02:26:12,078 --> 02:26:14,084
Full power behind!

1109
02:26:25,077 --> 02:26:27,073
Let the harpoon!

1110
02:26:29,084 --> 02:26:32,062
No cable, you idiot!

1111
02:26:32,086 --> 02:26:34,063
We are wrecked.

1112
02:26:34,087 --> 02:26:39,048
- We take in water.
- Man your weapons!

1113
02:26:39,072 --> 02:26:44,064
- Otherwise, I thought you were so clever.
- Close the food gap, Garvin.

1114
02:26:44,088 --> 02:26:48,060
Where did you go,
you cunning satan?

1115
02:26:48,084 --> 02:26:51,071
You probably think
you're cunning, huh?

1116
02:27:06,066 --> 02:27:07,068
Because!

1117
02:27:19,073 --> 02:27:22,051
- The pumps don't work.
- All men aboard!

1118
02:27:22,075 --> 02:27:25,081
Get him on board a
boat! Hurry up, guys!

1119
02:27:31,071 --> 02:27:35,052
- Neteyam!
- Do you need help, little brother?

1120
02:27:35,076 --> 02:27:38,075
Now clap in and cut us free.

1121
02:27:40,087 --> 02:27:43,081
- Get Tuk out of here.
- Hurry up!

1122
02:27:44,086 --> 02:27:49,072
Who is the mighty warrior?
Say it. Let's get away.

1123
02:27:51,066 --> 02:27:52,086
Lo'ak!

1124
02:27:53,066 --> 02:27:58,081
They have Spider. We have to save
him. Come on, we can't let him down.

1125
02:28:05,085 --> 02:28:07,085
Let go of me!

1126
02:28:10,068 --> 02:28:11,083
No!

1127
02:28:13,077 --> 02:28:14,077
Se!

1128
02:28:20,083 --> 02:28:25,047
- Up with you, baby.
- I'm not your cunt, you pig.

1129
02:28:25,071 --> 02:28:28,060
- We have to save her.
- Tuck, wait!

1130
02:28:28,084 --> 02:28:31,071
Sully is a stickler.

1131
02:28:41,085 --> 02:28:45,081
Wait, wait! Ready for departure!

1132
02:28:46,566 --> 02:28:48,579
- Tighten the mask.
- Leave me alone.

1133
02:28:51,583 --> 02:28:55,586
Hurry up! There
is an evacuation!

1134
02:28:58,575 --> 02:29:01,589
Tuk, this is not a good idea.

1135
02:29:22,580 --> 02:29:25,576
Cut here. Come on.

1136
02:29:33,576 --> 02:29:34,586
I have her.

1137
02:29:40,586 --> 02:29:43,552
We can still make it.

1138
02:29:43,576 --> 02:29:46,580
Now I'm tied up again!

1139
02:30:13,279 --> 02:30:15,296
- Come on bro. - Off.

1140
02:30:19,276 --> 02:30:20,291
Thanks, boys.

1141
02:30:21,296 --> 02:30:24,289
Race! Come on bro!

1142
02:30:25,296 --> 02:30:27,290
Run, run, run!

1143
02:30:29,291 --> 02:30:31,285
Give me that.

1144
02:30:35,276 --> 02:30:37,297
- Run, run, run! - This way!

1145
02:30:45,285 --> 02:30:46,294
In cover!

1146
02:30:52,287 --> 02:30:54,296
Can I say them?

1147
02:31:04,276 --> 02:31:07,283
Bro, that was too crazy.

1148
02:31:12,287 --> 02:31:14,264
- Hop on! - Come now.

1149
02:31:14,288 --> 02:31:17,289
Your skxawng. I am wounded.

1150
02:31:20,784 --> 02:31:23,779
Shit! Give me a hand!

1151
02:31:26,782 --> 02:31:29,775
- Hold him up! - I have him.

1152
02:31:31,791 --> 02:31:33,798
- Take him. - I have him.

1153
02:31:35,779 --> 02:31:38,786
- Holy shit. - Hold him up!

1154
02:31:39,798 --> 02:31:41,768
Come on bro.

1155
02:31:41,792 --> 02:31:45,758
- I have you. - Hurry up!

1156
02:31:45,782 --> 02:31:47,795
They have Kiri and Tuk.

1157
02:31:48,775 --> 02:31:50,786
I can't turn around.

1158
02:31:56,485 --> 02:31:59,498
Sheep! Help! It's Neteyam!

1159
02:32:00,478 --> 02:32:02,494
- Quick! - Take him.

1160
02:32:04,478 --> 02:32:08,496
Neteyam is hurt! Hurry up!

1161
02:32:09,497 --> 02:32:11,485
Pull!

1162
02:32:13,476 --> 02:32:14,492
Careful with his head.

1163
02:32:16,484 --> 02:32:17,497
Come now!

1164
02:32:20,486 --> 02:32:23,495
Careful with his head.

1165
02:32:24,475 --> 02:32:27,475
- Don't worry, bro, we've got you.
- Oh no.

1166
02:32:29,482 --> 02:32:32,481
Press down on it.

1167
02:32:33,482 --> 02:32:35,483
- Dad... - I'm here.

1168
02:32:39,483 --> 02:32:41,479
I'm with you, my boy.

1169
02:32:46,482 --> 02:32:48,479
I want to go home.

1170
02:32:50,480 --> 02:32:54,494
I know. We should
probably go home.

1171
02:32:57,489 --> 02:33:00,491
- It will probably work.
- Father...

1172
02:33:07,476 --> 02:33:08,488
Incomplete?

1173
02:33:13,482 --> 02:33:16,455
No no no...

1174
02:33:16,479 --> 02:33:17,497
Not finished!

1175
02:33:23,494 --> 02:33:27,480
Netay! No, All courage is...

1176
02:33:31,493 --> 02:33:35,495
My son! My son!

1177
02:33:41,495 --> 02:33:44,483
My son!

1178
02:33:52,481 --> 02:33:55,481
Can you hear me, Corporal?

1179
02:33:56,490 --> 02:34:00,457
I think you can.

1180
02:34:00,481 --> 02:34:03,485
I have your daughters.

1181
02:34:04,481 --> 02:34:06,488
Same offer as before.

1182
02:34:07,482 --> 02:34:09,484
You for them.

1183
02:34:13,491 --> 02:34:16,496
Where are your sisters

1184
02:34:17,476 --> 02:34:19,462
Where are they?

1185
02:34:19,486 --> 02:34:23,473
- I do not know.
- They are trapped on board the ship.

1186
02:34:23,497 --> 02:34:28,474
They are at the moonpool.
On the well deck, amidships.

1187
02:34:28,498 --> 02:34:32,469
Come, I'll show you.

1188
02:34:32,493 --> 02:34:38,456
Answer me, Corporal. Spit it out
or there will be consequences.

1189
02:34:38,480 --> 02:34:40,468
I have heard you.

1190
02:34:40,492 --> 02:34:45,495
Come on, we have to go. Come on.

1191
02:34:46,475 --> 02:34:48,492
Listen to me. Listen to me.

1192
02:34:50,484 --> 02:34:53,497
Listen to me. They
have our daughters.

1193
02:34:54,476 --> 02:34:56,486
They have our daughters.

1194
02:34:58,489 --> 02:35:03,466
I need you to be with me
and I need you to be strong.

1195
02:35:03,490 --> 02:35:08,458
Right now. Strong of heart.

1196
02:35:08,482 --> 02:35:10,496
Strong of heart.

1197
02:35:22,492 --> 02:35:25,495
Now we save our daughters.

1198
02:35:39,486 --> 02:35:42,495
- Stay with your brother.
- I want to go with you.

1199
02:35:45,497 --> 02:35:49,481
- You have done enough.
- Sheep...

1200
02:35:52,484 --> 02:35:53,495
The fire on hold.

1201
02:35:55,480 --> 02:35:56,473
Come on.

1202
02:35:56,497 --> 02:35:58,479
He's on his way.

1203
02:35:59,498 --> 02:36:01,475
Swim!

1204
02:36:03,483 --> 02:36:05,496
Now we neck him.
That's why we're here.

1205
02:36:10,497 --> 02:36:13,492
- Stay with him. - No!

1206
02:36:14,492 --> 02:36:16,496
Be careful, guys.

1207
02:36:37,482 --> 02:36:38,495
Not.

1208
02:36:46,483 --> 02:36:49,463
- Where are they?
- On the submarine deck.

1209
02:36:49,487 --> 02:36:53,490
There is a well in the middle.
They are at the railing.

1210
02:36:55,489 --> 02:36:57,496
No, stay here.

1211
02:36:59,493 --> 02:37:04,498
Talk to me, Corporal. The ship is sinking
and your girls are going down with it.

1212
02:37:06,476 --> 02:37:11,481
Your son didn't have to
die. It was your own fault.

1213
02:37:16,496 --> 02:37:21,471
You thought you could protect
your family, but you can't.

1214
02:37:21,495 --> 02:37:24,493
There is only one solution.

1215
02:37:27,491 --> 02:37:31,491
Now let's get this over with
before you lose another youngster.

1216
02:37:42,482 --> 02:37:44,482
In cover!

1217
02:38:25,491 --> 02:38:28,460
- Who is affected? - Zdinarsik?

1218
02:38:28,484 --> 02:38:29,497
Secured.

1219
02:38:30,476 --> 02:38:32,489
Prague, are you there?

1220
02:38:33,495 --> 02:38:35,475
Look up!

1221
02:38:44,476 --> 02:38:45,487
Forward!

1222
02:38:47,484 --> 02:38:48,498
To the left!

1223
02:38:49,478 --> 02:38:51,498
To the right. Surround her.

1224
02:39:37,482 --> 02:39:38,496
MaJake!

1225
02:39:44,487 --> 02:39:45,495
It's mother!

1226
02:39:52,482 --> 02:39:55,490
They come to kill you.

1227
02:40:46,487 --> 02:40:47,487
Far!

1228
02:40:50,498 --> 02:40:54,466
- Where is your sister?
- The path.

1229
02:40:54,490 --> 02:40:57,478
Stay behind me.

1230
02:41:01,484 --> 02:41:03,465
Skin!

1231
02:41:03,489 --> 02:41:06,471
Time is running out, Corporal.

1232
02:41:06,495 --> 02:41:10,462
Do you really want to
lose another youngster?

1233
02:41:10,486 --> 02:41:13,468
You shall not try!

1234
02:41:13,492 --> 02:41:16,455
Just kill him, dad!

1235
02:41:16,479 --> 02:41:17,495
Skin!

1236
02:41:18,475 --> 02:41:21,488
- Put down your weapons.
- You must not do that!

1237
02:41:23,485 --> 02:41:25,482
Kick them away.

1238
02:41:27,478 --> 02:41:28,490
Do it!

1239
02:41:30,498 --> 02:41:32,498
No...

1240
02:41:33,478 --> 02:41:36,462
- Put on handcuffs.
- Leave her alone.

1241
02:41:36,486 --> 02:41:41,467
Stay there! Don't
come one step closer.

1242
02:41:41,491 --> 02:41:45,470
- Handcuffs on!
- You stupid pig.

1243
02:41:45,494 --> 02:41:47,498
You mustn't do anything to her.

1244
02:41:50,487 --> 02:41:53,491
Let go or I'll cut.

1245
02:41:56,481 --> 02:41:58,482
What does the kid do to me?

1246
02:41:59,492 --> 02:42:03,461
He is not mine. We are
not even the same species.

1247
02:42:03,485 --> 02:42:08,460
You mustn't hurt
her. Let her go.

1248
02:42:08,484 --> 02:42:12,469
Now listen to me. Let her go.

1249
02:42:12,493 --> 02:42:18,476
- Mother, you must not kill him.
- A son for a son.

1250
02:42:19,482 --> 02:42:20,682
You mustn't hurt her.

1251
02:42:23,475 --> 02:42:27,481
- I cut. - Now just let her go.

1252
02:42:29,487 --> 02:42:31,492
No!

1253
02:42:39,490 --> 02:42:41,494
Kiri, Kiri...

1254
02:42:48,498 --> 02:42:52,463
- Spider!
- Get them out of here.

1255
02:42:52,487 --> 02:42:56,492
- Come with me.
- I owe you a death.

1256
02:42:59,476 --> 02:43:03,457
Mom, come on. Mother!

1257
02:43:03,481 --> 02:43:09,495
You're not vaporizing, are you,
Jake? You know I never give up.

1258
02:43:10,475 --> 02:43:14,484
I will come and kill
your whole family.

1259
02:43:15,933 --> 02:43:16,939
Far!

1260
02:43:17,954 --> 02:43:18,956
Come on.

1261
02:43:29,952 --> 02:43:31,938
Jake!

1262
02:43:34,946 --> 02:43:38,948
- The fire is coming!
- Back to the ship!

1263
02:43:41,952 --> 02:43:43,956
Stay close to me.

1264
02:43:46,946 --> 02:43:47,954
Tuk!

1265
02:43:48,948 --> 02:43:50,944
Mother, take my hand!

1266
02:43:53,945 --> 02:43:55,935
Mor!

1267
02:43:56,943 --> 02:43:58,956
Come on, Kiri, we have
to get out of here.

1268
02:44:02,941 --> 02:44:04,916
Climb up!

1269
02:44:04,940 --> 02:44:07,942
Come on, Kiri. Race!

1270
02:44:08,941 --> 02:44:11,951
Swim! Climb up, Tuk!

1271
02:44:19,937 --> 02:44:20,947
Race!

1272
02:44:21,943 --> 02:44:23,943
- Mother! - Run, run, run!

1273
02:44:30,956 --> 02:44:32,952
Crawl on!

1274
02:44:36,949 --> 02:44:38,947
I have you.

1275
02:44:39,951 --> 02:44:41,946
Give me your hand!

1276
02:44:44,936 --> 02:44:45,945
Open it up!

1277
02:44:53,938 --> 02:44:56,920
- Open it up! - Back, back!

1278
02:44:56,944 --> 02:44:57,945
Come on!

1279
02:44:58,953 --> 02:45:00,945
Tuk!

1280
02:45:09,951 --> 02:45:12,938
Up! Come on.

1281
02:45:14,933 --> 02:45:17,943
Crawl! Get up!

1282
02:45:23,936 --> 02:45:26,938
We're guessing! Further!

1283
02:45:39,944 --> 02:45:42,933
Kiri, on!

1284
02:45:45,933 --> 02:45:47,935
This way!

1285
02:45:52,935 --> 02:45:54,937
Open it up!

1286
02:45:56,933 --> 02:45:57,933
Mor!

1287
02:46:00,937 --> 02:46:01,942
Come on!

1288
02:46:10,950 --> 02:46:12,942
Further, Tuk.

1289
02:46:13,952 --> 02:46:15,956
We can't get out!

1290
02:46:17,935 --> 02:46:20,942
- We'll stay together, okay?
- Yes.

1291
02:46:49,949 --> 02:46:52,943
All courage is, help us!

1292
02:47:35,940 --> 02:47:36,949
Skin!

1293
02:47:56,953 --> 02:48:01,913
- Bridge!
- Mother and father are down there.

1294
02:48:01,937 --> 02:48:04,946
- Grab. - I'm ready.

1295
02:48:31,948 --> 02:48:33,941
Okay.

1296
02:49:00,933 --> 02:49:01,942
Jake!

1297
02:49:38,946 --> 02:49:39,956
Far?

1298
02:49:43,950 --> 02:49:44,954
Pis!

1299
02:49:59,950 --> 02:50:01,926
Come on, you fool.

1300
02:50:01,950 --> 02:50:04,914
- Breathe, Dad. - Neteyam?

1301
02:50:04,938 --> 02:50:06,926
No, it's Lo'ak.

1302
02:50:06,950 --> 02:50:10,915
- Oh, Lo'ak... - Sorry.

1303
02:50:10,939 --> 02:50:15,954
- Neteyam's death is my fault.
- Just concentrate on the present.

1304
02:50:34,933 --> 02:50:37,944
The air pocket disappears. We
have to go out. Come on, Dad.

1305
02:50:45,939 --> 02:50:49,956
- Can you find out from here?
- Yes, but it will be a long dive.

1306
02:50:50,936 --> 02:50:55,922
I can't handle it. But
you can. Hurry out.

1307
02:50:55,946 --> 02:50:59,933
I can't lose you too, Dad.

1308
02:51:02,953 --> 02:51:04,950
Mom, I'm scared.

1309
02:51:05,955 --> 02:51:10,955
It will be OK. Stick
with me. Stick to mom.

1310
02:51:12,956 --> 02:51:14,939
It will probably work.

1311
02:51:30,956 --> 02:51:35,919
You just need to calm your
heart and be completely calm.

1312
02:51:35,943 --> 02:51:38,951
Breathe from down here.

1313
02:51:52,942 --> 02:51:56,952
The being of water has
no beginning and no end.

1314
02:51:57,953 --> 02:52:01,921
The sea is around
you and in you.

1315
02:52:01,945 --> 02:52:05,935
The sea is your home before
your birth and after your death.

1316
02:52:10,942 --> 02:52:14,921
The sea gives and the sea takes.

1317
02:52:14,945 --> 02:52:16,955
Water ties everything together.

1318
02:52:18,950 --> 02:52:20,937
Life and death.

1319
02:52:22,935 --> 02:52:24,939
The dark and the light.

1320
02:52:47,945 --> 02:52:49,927
- Hi. - Kiri!

1321
02:52:49,951 --> 02:52:55,935
It'll be fine, little
sister. Mom, I give you this.

1322
02:52:59,943 --> 02:53:01,924
It will help you.

1323
02:53:01,948 --> 02:53:04,926
Dad, you're good.

1324
02:53:04,950 --> 02:53:08,950
Trust me. Say your heart.

1325
02:53:09,952 --> 02:53:11,952
Deep breaths.

1326
02:53:14,941 --> 02:53:16,945
Last breath.

1327
02:53:20,933 --> 02:53:21,955
Follow me.

1328
02:54:37,952 --> 02:54:41,933
Hang on. Just breathe.

1329
02:54:46,944 --> 02:54:47,944
So.

1330
02:54:56,940 --> 02:54:58,955
I see you, my son.

1331
02:55:01,949 --> 02:55:03,930
MaJake!

1332
02:55:03,954 --> 02:55:06,955
Far! Far!

1333
02:55:07,955 --> 02:55:10,917
Came. Come here.

1334
02:55:10,941 --> 02:55:13,949
- Tuck! - I have you.

1335
02:55:18,946 --> 02:55:19,946
Brother.

1336
02:55:29,933 --> 02:55:32,933
Sully is a stickler.

1337
02:55:33,940 --> 02:55:36,914
That was our biggest weakness -

1338
02:55:36,938 --> 02:55:39,914
- and our great strength.

1339
02:55:39,938 --> 02:55:43,938
Thank you, Al mod er. Thanks.

1340
02:56:22,943 --> 02:56:24,952
Let's get away.

1341
02:56:30,933 --> 02:56:32,922
My boy...

1342
02:56:32,946 --> 02:56:34,946
Come along.

1343
02:56:39,934 --> 02:56:40,949
Spider!

1344
02:57:15,059 --> 02:57:16,080
Abekat!

1345
02:57:20,076 --> 02:57:22,079
Spider.

1346
02:57:29,065 --> 02:57:31,079
- Are you all right? - Yes.

1347
02:57:34,074 --> 02:57:36,069
Come here.

1348
02:57:38,074 --> 02:57:41,081
A son for a son.

1349
02:57:57,072 --> 02:58:00,069
All singing cords
have a final bead.

1350
02:58:24,081 --> 02:58:29,071
A father protects. That
is his purpose in life.

1351
02:58:57,069 --> 02:59:01,059
The people say that all
energy is only borrowed.

1352
02:59:03,065 --> 02:59:06,065
One day you have
to give it back.

1353
02:59:18,081 --> 02:59:23,057
Eywa takes care of
all her children.

1354
02:59:23,081 --> 02:59:25,081
Nothing ever goes away.

1355
02:59:28,079 --> 02:59:31,070
Not finished!

1356
02:59:51,076 --> 02:59:55,056
My family and I are
leaving tomorrow.

1357
02:59:55,080 --> 02:59:58,046
Far away from here.

1358
02:59:58,070 --> 03:00:04,072
Your son is with our ancestors.
You are metkayinas now.

1359
03:00:09,078 --> 03:00:12,081
That's how it happened.

1360
03:00:13,062 --> 03:00:15,077
We are sea people now.

1361
03:00:17,063 --> 03:00:20,071
This is our home.

1362
03:01:19,081 --> 03:01:23,041
Sheep! Look what I caught!

1363
03:01:23,065 --> 03:01:26,079
Wow, that's a big crab.

1364
03:01:27,059 --> 03:01:33,060
It was over there by the
rocks, just like you said.

1365
03:01:37,059 --> 03:01:41,066
What's the matter, dad?
Why are you crying?

1366
03:01:42,081 --> 03:01:45,070
I'm just glad to see you.

1367
03:01:47,063 --> 03:01:49,078
I'm glad to see you too.

1368
03:01:51,067 --> 03:01:53,079
You try.

1369
03:01:55,065 --> 03:01:56,080
Okay.

1370
03:01:58,059 --> 03:02:01,078
- Have you left me any? - Maybe.

1371
03:02:07,059 --> 03:02:08,079
Now look there.

1372
03:02:16,067 --> 03:02:21,057
Now I see it. I can't save
my family by running away.

1373
03:02:21,081 --> 03:02:26,057
This is our home, our fortress.

1374
03:02:26,081 --> 03:02:30,070
This is where we stand.

1375
