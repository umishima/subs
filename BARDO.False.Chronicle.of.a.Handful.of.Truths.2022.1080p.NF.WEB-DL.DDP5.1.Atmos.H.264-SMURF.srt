1
00:03:59,333 --> 00:04:01,958
- He doesn't want to come out.
- What?

2
00:04:02,041 --> 00:04:03,416
He wants to stay inside.

3
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:04,791
Why?

4
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:07,291
He says the world's too fucked up.

5
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:11,583
Do you have any allergies?

6
00:04:11,666 --> 00:04:14,791
- No, but...
- Please, don't move.

7
00:04:14,875 --> 00:04:16,833
- Okay.
- Open your legs, please.

8
00:04:21,708 --> 00:04:22,791
Just breathe.

9
00:04:22,875 --> 00:04:24,083
- Relax.
- Yes.

10
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:29,333
You can do it, little guy.

11
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:36,125
That's it. It's over.

12
00:04:36,208 --> 00:04:38,875
- You did well.
- Great job.

13
00:04:41,333 --> 00:04:42,583
That's it.

14
00:04:45,791 --> 00:04:46,791
Well done.

15
00:05:02,791 --> 00:05:05,250
- What happened?
- He decided to stay inside.

16
00:05:05,333 --> 00:05:08,875
- Who?
- Mateo. He doesn't want to come out.

17
00:05:31,625 --> 00:05:33,166
I saw some scissors back there.

18
00:05:55,791 --> 00:05:56,875
Now what?

19
00:05:57,458 --> 00:05:58,541
I don't know.

20
00:05:59,541 --> 00:06:01,666
How's he going to feed himself?

21
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:04,125
He'll eat me, I guess.

22
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:08,500
And you.

23
00:06:32,791 --> 00:06:39,125
BARDO, FALSE CHRONICLE
OF A HANDFUL OF TRUTHS

24
00:06:44,583 --> 00:06:47,143
<i>Welcome aboard the Metro Expo Line.</i>

25
00:06:47,583 --> 00:06:50,083
<i>This train's final destination is</i>

26
00:06:50,625 --> 00:06:52,916
<i>Downtown Santa Monica station.</i>

27
00:06:55,625 --> 00:06:59,583
<i>The next stop
is Expo Park/USC station.</i>

28
00:07:00,416 --> 00:07:02,250
Is that normal?

29
00:07:03,458 --> 00:07:05,750
That sound. Is it normal?

30
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:34,500
<i>Thanks for going Metro.</i>

31
00:07:35,916 --> 00:07:38,500
<i>Your safety is our top priority.</i>

32
00:07:39,416 --> 00:07:42,791
<i>Help us help you by keeping
your valuables and money out of sight.</i>

33
00:07:42,875 --> 00:07:45,625
<i>Report any activity
by calling Metro's law enforcement</i>

34
00:07:45,708 --> 00:07:49,666
<i>and security hotline at 888-950-SAFE.</i>

35
00:07:51,375 --> 00:07:53,625
<i>If you see something, say something.</i>

36
00:07:56,375 --> 00:07:58,125
<i>The next stop is</i>

37
00:07:58,833 --> 00:08:01,166
<i>La Cienega/Jefferson station.</i>

38
00:08:06,208 --> 00:08:09,458
<i>What most believed
to be a rumor now appears to be reality.</i>

39
00:08:09,541 --> 00:08:12,958
<i>After weeks of increasing tension
between the two countries, Carlos Soler...</i>

40
00:08:13,041 --> 00:08:14,041
Shit.

41
00:08:14,083 --> 00:08:15,892
<i>...United Mexican States,</i>

42
00:08:15,916 --> 00:08:19,250
<i>visited the White House today to meet
with Halbrook's secretary of state.</i>

43
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:22,083
<i>Not many details are known,
but our sources assure us</i>

44
00:08:22,166 --> 00:08:24,958
<i>that the US government
may have approved Amazon's plan</i>

45
00:08:25,041 --> 00:08:28,000
<i>of buying the Mexican state
of Baja California.</i>

46
00:08:28,083 --> 00:08:29,750
<i>That's right, you heard it.</i>

47
00:08:29,833 --> 00:08:31,750
<i>Amazon, the American multinational,</i>

48
00:08:31,833 --> 00:08:35,208
<i>is interested in buying
the Mexican state of Baja California</i>

49
00:08:35,291 --> 00:08:37,708
<i>and has the full support
of the US government.</i>

50
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:43,083
<i>This is all Presidents Halbrook and Soler
had to say at today's press conference.</i>

51
00:08:44,875 --> 00:08:47,208
<i>Borderlines are human-made.</i>

52
00:08:47,291 --> 00:08:50,500
<i>These must be subordinated to human needs.</i>

53
00:08:50,583 --> 00:08:53,000
<i>By moving down the border,
a third-world territory</i>

54
00:08:53,083 --> 00:08:56,375
<i>could maybe even become
a first-world promised land.</i>

55
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
<i>Mexican President Soler
and I want this historic transaction</i>

56
00:09:00,083 --> 00:09:02,583
<i>to be an homage for both of our countries.</i>

57
00:09:03,458 --> 00:09:06,041
<i>We must celebrate
this economic integration</i>

58
00:09:06,125 --> 00:09:07,750
<i>of imperial dimensions.</i>

59
00:09:08,416 --> 00:09:11,375
<i>Negotiation, not invasion.</i>

60
00:09:11,458 --> 00:09:15,791
<i>It is the Mexican people
this sale will benefit...</i>

61
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:45,250
He's been waiting.

62
00:10:54,458 --> 00:10:56,166
Ambassador Jones.

63
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:57,625
Oh, Mr. Gama.

64
00:10:58,333 --> 00:11:00,083
Have they moved you into the castle?

65
00:11:00,166 --> 00:11:03,750
No, there's just
some event here this evening,

66
00:11:03,833 --> 00:11:06,416
and the Mexican government's
asked me to say a few words.

67
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:08,541
But they're rehearsing this afternoon.

68
00:11:08,625 --> 00:11:11,041
I'm sorry to make you come out this far.

69
00:11:11,125 --> 00:11:12,833
No, no. It's fine. It's fine.

70
00:11:12,916 --> 00:11:17,041
For a minute, I thought President Halbrook
had appointed you emperor of Mexico.

71
00:11:17,125 --> 00:11:18,750
Not yet.

72
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:23,000
What's going on out there?

73
00:11:23,083 --> 00:11:26,125
Well, as you are well aware, we are having

74
00:11:26,208 --> 00:11:30,333
a celebration for the 175th anniversary
of the end of the Mexican-American War.

75
00:11:30,416 --> 00:11:31,708
"Celebration"?

76
00:11:31,791 --> 00:11:33,375
Well, a... a tribute.

77
00:11:33,875 --> 00:11:36,791
Yeah, to be fair, it was not a war.
It was an invasion.

78
00:11:36,875 --> 00:11:40,208
Young men on both sides
pointed guns at one another.

79
00:11:40,708 --> 00:11:42,041
So many lives lost.

80
00:11:42,125 --> 00:11:43,541
Yeah, you lost a few thousand.

81
00:11:43,625 --> 00:11:46,375
We lost way more than that
and half of our country.

82
00:11:46,458 --> 00:11:48,625
Well, to be fair, you didn't <i>lose</i>.

83
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:53,250
Well, that's true
because you just took it.

84
00:11:53,333 --> 00:11:54,708
- We paid for it.
- Yeah.

85
00:11:54,791 --> 00:11:56,791
Yeah, 15 million pesos.

86
00:11:57,666 --> 00:12:00,125
Well, let's not talk about the past.
Would you like some tea?

87
00:12:00,208 --> 00:12:01,250
No, thank you.

88
00:12:02,333 --> 00:12:06,083
I've been trying to get an interview
with President Halbrook for months.

89
00:12:06,833 --> 00:12:09,000
I went as far
as promising his chief of staff

90
00:12:09,083 --> 00:12:11,791
to landscape
the White House lawn for free.

91
00:12:11,875 --> 00:12:13,416
Oh, you!

92
00:12:15,833 --> 00:12:17,833
I think I might be able
to finally help you.

93
00:12:17,916 --> 00:12:18,916
Really?

94
00:12:19,875 --> 00:12:23,083
What would you say
to an exclusive interview,

95
00:12:23,166 --> 00:12:25,541
you and the president,
one hour, in the Oval Office?

96
00:12:25,625 --> 00:12:28,000
- Are you being serious, now?
- I am.

97
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:30,291
Though we'd need you to do something.

98
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:32,083
Oh, I figured as much, yeah.

99
00:12:32,166 --> 00:12:35,791
The president knows you are
an important voice in Latin America.

100
00:12:35,875 --> 00:12:37,958
We've been working
for months on this new deal.

101
00:12:38,041 --> 00:12:40,208
- That's why I want to talk to him.
- Listen.

102
00:12:40,291 --> 00:12:42,791
It is essential
that this administration build a bridge

103
00:12:42,875 --> 00:12:45,458
with the Latin community
and with Mexico in particular.

104
00:12:45,541 --> 00:12:48,041
And with you winning this Alethea Award,

105
00:12:48,125 --> 00:12:51,708
you'll move front and center
in the world of serious journalism.

106
00:12:53,958 --> 00:12:56,791
You know I'm not going to agree
to change my speech.

107
00:12:56,875 --> 00:12:58,958
- I thought you hadn't written it.
- I haven't.

108
00:12:59,041 --> 00:13:01,458
So, you won't have to change it, then.

109
00:13:05,208 --> 00:13:10,250
And maybe with this exclusive interview
in mind, you find a new thread.

110
00:13:11,166 --> 00:13:12,291
Steven!

111
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:14,083
Anyway, think about it.

112
00:13:15,458 --> 00:13:16,666
Do you mind?

113
00:13:17,833 --> 00:13:19,458
Here we go.

114
00:13:25,208 --> 00:13:26,333
Let me walk you out.

115
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:30,000
So, how's your family?

116
00:13:30,083 --> 00:13:32,333
Oh, fine.
Fine, thank you. Everybody's fine.

117
00:13:32,416 --> 00:13:35,458
Now, you're gonna have
to show me around here.

118
00:13:40,375 --> 00:13:42,583
I used to come here
when I was a kid.

119
00:13:42,666 --> 00:13:43,916
Did you study here?

120
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,125
No, they brought us here
to learn about the <i>Niños Héroes</i>.

121
00:13:47,208 --> 00:13:48,333
You know what that is?

122
00:13:48,416 --> 00:13:49,500
Oh, yeah.

123
00:13:50,208 --> 00:13:53,458
No. No, I don't.

124
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:55,708
Toward the end
of the Mexican-American War,

125
00:13:55,791 --> 00:13:57,583
a group of students, cadets,

126
00:13:57,666 --> 00:14:01,208
were surrounded by American soldiers,
right here in this castle.

127
00:14:01,958 --> 00:14:04,708
The reality is
they were simply slaughtered.

128
00:14:04,791 --> 00:14:08,000
But with time,
a myth was formed around that event.

129
00:14:08,083 --> 00:14:09,541
What myth?

130
00:14:28,708 --> 00:14:30,291
Go, go!

131
00:14:30,375 --> 00:14:31,583
Move, move!

132
00:15:05,625 --> 00:15:07,333
Go, go, go, go!

133
00:15:21,375 --> 00:15:23,000
They were kids.

134
00:15:23,083 --> 00:15:24,083
Yeah.

135
00:15:24,833 --> 00:15:27,333
That's why we call them the Boy Heroes.

136
00:15:30,333 --> 00:15:33,416
Exalted compatriots!

137
00:15:35,083 --> 00:15:38,375
Before it falls in the hands of the enemy,

138
00:15:39,625 --> 00:15:42,291
I take with me the flag of the fatherland!

139
00:15:42,375 --> 00:15:45,750
May the myth rise over Mexico

140
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:48,500
and give shelter to us forevermore!

141
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:52,500
<i>¡Viva México, cabrones!</i>

142
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,541
Oh, fuck.

143
00:16:04,875 --> 00:16:06,916
Have you written your speech yet?

144
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:14,000
Oh, only Mexicans can turn
disgraceful defeat into mythic victory.

145
00:16:28,791 --> 00:16:30,231
Señor Silverio?

146
00:16:30,958 --> 00:16:34,625
- Got a headache?
- A little.

147
00:16:34,708 --> 00:16:37,250
The altitude and the pollution
always kill me

148
00:16:37,333 --> 00:16:39,208
my first few days back in Mexico.

149
00:16:39,291 --> 00:16:42,916
The same happens to my dad
when he comes back to the capital.

150
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,291
He says Mexico's not a country
but a state of mind.

151
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:50,000
That's a good one. How is your dad?

152
00:16:50,083 --> 00:16:52,791
Good. Stuck in Oaxaca.
His emphysema's killing him.

153
00:16:52,875 --> 00:16:54,583
That's too bad. Say hi to him for me.

154
00:16:54,666 --> 00:16:57,041
Sure. You want me to stop at a pharmacy?

155
00:16:57,125 --> 00:16:59,583
Nah. Thanks, Antonio.

156
00:16:59,666 --> 00:17:03,583
So I heard on the radio you're going to be
on Luis Valdivia's TV show.

157
00:17:03,666 --> 00:17:07,250
Yeah. I didn't want to,
but you know how Lucía is.

158
00:17:07,333 --> 00:17:10,083
She forced me to take the invite.

159
00:17:11,083 --> 00:17:15,291
But... didn't you see what he said
about your last documentary?

160
00:17:15,375 --> 00:17:17,875
Luis? No. What'd he say?

161
00:17:19,625 --> 00:17:21,166
Nothing good, sir.

162
00:17:21,666 --> 00:17:23,583
He said you were worse than Malinche.

163
00:17:23,666 --> 00:17:27,750
That you disrespected journalism
and who knows what else.

164
00:17:29,125 --> 00:17:31,750
It's docufiction, Antonio.

165
00:17:31,833 --> 00:17:35,208
If you don't know how to play around,
you don't deserve to be taken seriously.

166
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:39,333
Truth is, I didn't watch
your documentary, sir.

167
00:17:39,833 --> 00:17:43,583
But I did see that guy on TV,
and he pissed me off.

168
00:17:48,666 --> 00:17:50,500
Luis is wrapping up a meeting,

169
00:17:50,583 --> 00:17:52,708
but he told me
he'll find you in makeup, okay?

170
00:17:52,791 --> 00:17:54,458
Congratulations, maestro.

171
00:17:54,541 --> 00:17:56,166
Welcome back.

172
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:58,041
Thanks!

173
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:02,083
Hey, when's the last time
you were on here?

174
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:03,750
Oof.

175
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:06,625
More than 30 years ago, I guess.

176
00:18:06,708 --> 00:18:09,041
Thirty? That's my age.

177
00:18:09,125 --> 00:18:10,708
Welcome again. Go ahead.

178
00:18:17,875 --> 00:18:19,208
Welcome.

179
00:18:20,833 --> 00:18:22,625
Hey, can you open up?

180
00:18:32,833 --> 00:18:35,208
We're back on <i>Bocaguanga</i>.

181
00:18:35,291 --> 00:18:38,458
We've got a breaking story
you won't believe.

182
00:18:38,541 --> 00:18:41,125
No one lifted a finger to help him.

183
00:18:41,208 --> 00:18:43,541
At the train's last stop,
he was the last passenger.

184
00:18:43,625 --> 00:18:44,666
Fucking gringos.

185
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:46,250
A cleaning lady found him.

186
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:49,541
A compatriot of ours,
Ms. Refugio Domínguez.

187
00:18:49,625 --> 00:18:50,750
Hello, Refugio.

188
00:18:50,833 --> 00:18:53,166
<i>- Hi.</i>
- We caught up with her.

189
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:56,166
We'll have the pleasure
of speaking with her.

190
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:58,559
Thanks for joining us.
Tell us what happened.

191
00:18:58,583 --> 00:19:03,166
<i>I went in to clean the train car,
as usual, and saw it wasn't empty.</i>

192
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:07,791
<i>I thought at first the guy might be
a drunk because that's common here.</i>

193
00:19:07,875 --> 00:19:09,833
<i>But then I saw the fish on the floor.</i>

194
00:19:09,916 --> 00:19:11,875
<i>They were all dead...</i>

195
00:19:11,958 --> 00:19:15,291
Come on!
Yeah! Go on! Attention!

196
00:19:17,416 --> 00:19:18,416
Don't go! I...

197
00:19:18,458 --> 00:19:21,250
- ...seven, eight...
- You can't go there!

198
00:19:40,708 --> 00:19:42,708
Wait! Wait! Wait!

199
00:19:42,791 --> 00:19:45,541
Silverio, I... Sorry. I'm sorry!

200
00:19:46,083 --> 00:19:47,500
Silverio, wait. Wait.

201
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,625
Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop!

202
00:19:59,708 --> 00:20:02,666
You're out of sync!

203
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:05,583
- Tania, I said to the right!
- Fuck you! What do you know?

204
00:20:05,666 --> 00:20:09,000
Tania, it's always the same shit with you!

205
00:20:09,083 --> 00:20:12,250
Everyone, take your positions.
Priscilla, on your mark.

206
00:20:12,333 --> 00:20:14,833
Five, six, seven, eight.

207
00:20:15,333 --> 00:20:18,250
This way.

208
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,916
We are here. I'm going to leave you here.

209
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,375
- Thanks.
- No problem.

210
00:20:31,208 --> 00:20:32,750
Do my eyes deceive me?

211
00:20:32,833 --> 00:20:34,916
Hello, Marta.

212
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,416
Silverio Gama.

213
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:40,833
I thought you stepped on a landmine
in Afghanistan and got blown to bits.

214
00:20:40,916 --> 00:20:42,916
I'm still here. In one piece. For now.

215
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,875
- How long has it been?
- Ages.

216
00:20:44,958 --> 00:20:46,000
Centuries.

217
00:20:46,083 --> 00:20:49,000
- Sorry, I was really...
- Busy. I know.

218
00:20:49,083 --> 00:20:53,250
But you could have found a minute
between documentaries to visit me.

219
00:20:53,333 --> 00:20:55,583
Come on, sit down.

220
00:20:56,208 --> 00:20:58,541
- Is this what you're wearing?
- Should I take it off?

221
00:20:58,625 --> 00:20:59,750
Yeah, right?

222
00:21:00,458 --> 00:21:02,708
Luis tried very hard
to be happy for you.

223
00:21:03,208 --> 00:21:05,500
He sent me six bottles of prosecco.

224
00:21:05,583 --> 00:21:10,041
That's his way
of congratulating you without saying it.

225
00:21:10,666 --> 00:21:12,875
He never got over you abandoning him.

226
00:21:12,958 --> 00:21:14,791
I didn't abandon him.

227
00:21:14,875 --> 00:21:18,333
I left for a year,
and it turned into 20.

228
00:21:18,416 --> 00:21:21,416
I ran away from the censors,
and now look where we are.

229
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:22,500
Hmm.

230
00:21:22,583 --> 00:21:25,750
I worked hard to make a name for myself
as an independent journalist,

231
00:21:25,833 --> 00:21:27,583
then as a filmmaker.

232
00:21:27,666 --> 00:21:31,250
My mother still thinks
it was the worst decision of my life.

233
00:21:34,375 --> 00:21:36,291
Luis could have gone too.

234
00:21:36,375 --> 00:21:38,041
No one put a gun to his head.

235
00:21:38,125 --> 00:21:42,458
Well, one time he criticized
the ineptitude of Mexico's president

236
00:21:42,541 --> 00:21:44,250
and his apostles, and...

237
00:21:44,791 --> 00:21:48,166
The head of the station
comes through swinging his dick,

238
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:50,458
calls him while he's on air,

239
00:21:50,541 --> 00:21:54,083
and nearly strings him up
by his balls on stage.

240
00:21:54,166 --> 00:21:57,208
It's a miracle he's still got his show.

241
00:21:57,916 --> 00:21:59,875
There are no heroes on this channel.

242
00:22:00,375 --> 00:22:02,208
We all eat the same shit.

243
00:22:02,708 --> 00:22:05,416
We're terrified of losing
what little we've got.

244
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:12,583
Tania?

245
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:15,750
What?

246
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:20,208
Tania Kristel?

247
00:22:22,958 --> 00:22:24,458
What are you looking at?

248
00:22:24,541 --> 00:22:25,625
Sorry.

249
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:37,958
Do I know you?

250
00:22:39,083 --> 00:22:42,500
No, but I know you.
I used to watch you on TV all the time.

251
00:22:49,708 --> 00:22:51,000
What are you thinking?

252
00:23:05,916 --> 00:23:08,291
Don Silverio Gama!

253
00:23:08,375 --> 00:23:11,291
- Luis, my man.
- Where have you been, <i>cabrón</i>?

254
00:23:11,375 --> 00:23:12,458
Hey.

255
00:23:12,541 --> 00:23:13,625
Welcome back.

256
00:23:13,708 --> 00:23:16,250
Give me a hug, <i>cabrón.</i>
Leave him alone, Marta.

257
00:23:16,333 --> 00:23:17,958
I will when I'm done.

258
00:23:18,041 --> 00:23:19,666
There's no fixing that face.

259
00:23:21,250 --> 00:23:22,500
Give me five.

260
00:23:22,583 --> 00:23:24,625
- Don't move.
- What are you doing?

261
00:23:24,708 --> 00:23:29,250
- Epic. My Twitter's going to blow up.
- Enough!

262
00:23:29,333 --> 00:23:30,833
Don't be an asshole, <i>cabrón</i>.

263
00:23:30,916 --> 00:23:31,916
Look at him.

264
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,291
He's still mad
I left him in the lurch, right?

265
00:23:35,375 --> 00:23:36,583
Furious!

266
00:23:36,666 --> 00:23:40,541
I've got the top-rated talk show
in Mexico, <i>Papá.</i>

267
00:23:40,625 --> 00:23:42,465
Yeah, you only interview YouTubers.
Nice stuff.

268
00:23:44,375 --> 00:23:47,708
That's news too, isn't it?

269
00:23:47,791 --> 00:23:48,958
Ready.

270
00:23:49,041 --> 00:23:50,500
Give me a hug, bro.

271
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:55,208
- I missed you. Here is where we started.
- That's right.

272
00:23:55,291 --> 00:23:57,791
- How many days are you staying? Huh?
- Not many.

273
00:23:58,583 --> 00:24:01,041
Did you already prepare
your speech for the ceremony?

274
00:24:01,125 --> 00:24:02,125
No.

275
00:24:02,208 --> 00:24:04,083
Oof. I figured.

276
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:10,166
Hey, I loved your last documentary,
<i>False Chronicle of a Handful of Truths</i>.

277
00:24:10,250 --> 00:24:11,916
<i>- </i>Crazy stuff.
<i>- </i>You liked it?

278
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,708
Tons.

279
00:24:13,791 --> 00:24:18,208
But the part where you share a smoke
with Hernán Cortés was a bit much.

280
00:24:18,291 --> 00:24:22,166
How are you supposed to know
what Cortés or Juan Escutia was thinking?

281
00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:25,458
Did you run out of living people
to interview, or what?

282
00:24:25,541 --> 00:24:30,333
- You already working on the next one?
- Yeah, I mean, I'm raising money.

283
00:24:30,416 --> 00:24:32,958
It's going to be months of research,
lots of travel.

284
00:24:33,041 --> 00:24:36,375
I don't know how you can spend
so much time on one thing.

285
00:24:36,458 --> 00:24:39,708
The world changes
with every week, every day, every tweet.

286
00:24:39,791 --> 00:24:41,833
- Ten seconds.
- My questions?

287
00:24:41,916 --> 00:24:44,916
- I already gave them to you.
- I don't have my questions.

288
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:48,416
Wait, yeah. I've got them. Good to go.

289
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:50,791
Come on! Come on!

290
00:24:50,875 --> 00:24:52,458
Relax.

291
00:24:55,583 --> 00:24:57,833
Welcome to another episode
of <i>Let's Suppose</i>.

292
00:24:57,916 --> 00:24:59,833
We've got a special show today.

293
00:24:59,916 --> 00:25:02,166
Here with me is my close friend

294
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:04,958
and former copresenter
on the eight o'clock news, Silverio Gama.

295
00:25:05,041 --> 00:25:08,583
Renowned documentary filmmaker
and the first, that's right,

296
00:25:08,666 --> 00:25:13,250
the first Mexican to receive
the Alethea Award for journalistic ethics,

297
00:25:13,333 --> 00:25:16,750
given every four years
by the American Society of Journalists.

298
00:25:16,833 --> 00:25:22,250
You'll be getting it
in Los Angeles in just a few days.

299
00:25:22,791 --> 00:25:28,125
This interview is sponsored
by Los Molinos Coffee.

300
00:25:28,208 --> 00:25:29,458
Mm.

301
00:25:29,958 --> 00:25:31,041
Simply delicious.

302
00:25:31,125 --> 00:25:34,125
How are you?
How do you feel being back in your Mexico?

303
00:25:34,208 --> 00:25:38,000
I can't imagine how nervous you are.
There's a lot riding on this award, no?

304
00:25:42,541 --> 00:25:43,625
Silverio?

305
00:25:44,583 --> 00:25:46,041
Are you with us?

306
00:25:46,791 --> 00:25:48,333
Can we check his mic?

307
00:25:48,416 --> 00:25:53,500
I think we've got a mic problem.

308
00:25:53,583 --> 00:25:56,750
My apologies.
This is the risk of doing live TV.

309
00:25:56,833 --> 00:25:59,208
Let me shoot straight, Silverio.

310
00:25:59,291 --> 00:26:02,583
Some of our colleagues say
American liberals are using you,

311
00:26:02,666 --> 00:26:08,125
and this award is to compensate for
the far right's attacks on our country.

312
00:26:08,208 --> 00:26:09,916
Are you aware of this?

313
00:26:10,958 --> 00:26:13,083
Let's suppose
they're giving you this award

314
00:26:13,166 --> 00:26:16,000
to please a community full of Mexicans...

315
00:26:18,333 --> 00:26:20,250
...in Los Angeles.

316
00:26:21,333 --> 00:26:23,291
Do you not want to talk about it?

317
00:26:24,041 --> 00:26:26,416
Let's talk about your private life, then.

318
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:28,500
As the great Sainte-Beuve said,

319
00:26:28,583 --> 00:26:32,041
a man's private life, what he does,
the decisions he makes every day,

320
00:26:32,125 --> 00:26:34,291
even what he eats, all define his work.

321
00:26:35,333 --> 00:26:38,833
Is it true it upset you
that they called you "darky" as a child?

322
00:26:40,458 --> 00:26:45,000
That it embarrassed your mother
and grandmother that you looked,

323
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:47,708
well, darker than you should?

324
00:26:47,791 --> 00:26:50,541
More Indigenous than white?

325
00:26:52,166 --> 00:26:54,375
Was that disdain real?

326
00:26:54,458 --> 00:26:56,083
It's your family, no?

327
00:26:56,916 --> 00:26:57,958
Señor...

328
00:26:58,458 --> 00:27:02,791
Alejandra Bravo told us, on Instagram...
Remember your first girlfriend?

329
00:27:02,875 --> 00:27:06,458
At 16, you ran away with her
to have a great adventure,

330
00:27:06,541 --> 00:27:09,625
but you refused
to take off your underwear!

331
00:27:12,166 --> 00:27:15,750
Because you were scared
of God's wrath, of hell...

332
00:27:15,833 --> 00:27:17,250
What were you thinking?

333
00:27:17,333 --> 00:27:22,583
You'd show up
at the altar a virgin?

334
00:27:22,666 --> 00:27:25,666
The great Silverio Gama
was a dark-skinned car washer,

335
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:28,791
a chump, a two-bit radio announcer.

336
00:27:28,875 --> 00:27:31,125
But today he has an honorary degree
from the UNAM.

337
00:27:31,208 --> 00:27:34,416
He's a <i>Chevalier des Arts</i> in France,
and he didn't even finish college.

338
00:27:37,666 --> 00:27:40,083
He's an entitled bougie bastard

339
00:27:40,166 --> 00:27:45,708
on a mission to portray misery
and poverty and society's outcasts,

340
00:27:45,791 --> 00:27:48,375
but he's best friends
with this station's owner.

341
00:27:48,458 --> 00:27:51,500
And his family supports
the <i>Club América de Fútbol.</i>

342
00:27:59,750 --> 00:28:03,125
How's the "guard dog
of the truth" feel on the receiving end?

343
00:28:04,666 --> 00:28:07,208
You spent years making TV ads
for capitalism,

344
00:28:07,291 --> 00:28:08,811
but all of a sudden you're an artiste.

345
00:28:15,166 --> 00:28:18,041
I guess our friend
doesn't feel like talking.

346
00:28:18,125 --> 00:28:20,958
A word to the wise is sufficient.

347
00:28:26,666 --> 00:28:27,916
Amazing, Silverio.

348
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,375
You'll gladly run your trap
for the gringos and whoever else,

349
00:28:31,458 --> 00:28:33,541
but here you clam up.

350
00:28:36,041 --> 00:28:37,666
A real shame.

351
00:28:38,166 --> 00:28:40,750
We'll take a quick commercial break.
We'll be back.

352
00:29:25,750 --> 00:29:27,000
<i>Silverio.</i>

353
00:29:32,583 --> 00:29:33,833
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

354
00:29:40,125 --> 00:29:43,083
I got held up.

355
00:29:43,166 --> 00:29:44,541
<i>Where are you?</i>

356
00:29:45,333 --> 00:29:50,083
I was trying to get
an interview with Halbrook.

357
00:29:51,208 --> 00:29:52,708
<i>I feel you can hear me.</i>

358
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:55,750
I hear you, Lucía.

359
00:30:16,708 --> 00:30:18,208
There you are.

360
00:30:18,291 --> 00:30:20,125
- Where'd you get off to?
- I don't know.

361
00:30:20,208 --> 00:30:22,666
- What do you mean?
- I was out and about.

362
00:30:22,750 --> 00:30:24,833
Why didn't you go
to your interview with Luis?

363
00:30:25,458 --> 00:30:26,875
You want something to drink?

364
00:30:28,166 --> 00:30:30,708
The <i>Let's Suppose </i>producers
haven't stopped calling.

365
00:30:30,791 --> 00:30:32,083
Uh-huh.

366
00:30:32,166 --> 00:30:34,541
- I didn't know what to say.
- I'll call them later.

367
00:30:34,625 --> 00:30:37,000
Luis was calling all day. He's furious.

368
00:30:37,083 --> 00:30:39,875
He told me they spent
the whole week hyping up the interview.

369
00:30:39,958 --> 00:30:41,916
You're the one who accepted.
I didn't want to go.

370
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,208
So now it's my fault.

371
00:30:49,125 --> 00:30:53,250
I was afraid they'd humiliate me,
make me a laughingstock.

372
00:30:53,333 --> 00:30:54,833
Why would they?

373
00:30:56,625 --> 00:30:59,000
Because the whole thing's a joke.

374
00:30:59,083 --> 00:31:00,625
What is?

375
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,791
I go around seeking approval
from people who despise me.

376
00:31:08,416 --> 00:31:13,125
I act before I think,
hoping to get what I want, then when I do,

377
00:31:13,208 --> 00:31:14,541
I detest it.

378
00:31:15,708 --> 00:31:19,000
And I'm ashamed I ever wanted it.

379
00:31:19,083 --> 00:31:21,416
What are you talking about?

380
00:31:21,916 --> 00:31:23,708
I spend
my life convincing myself

381
00:31:23,791 --> 00:31:27,666
of the importance of what I do,
of the value of recognition.

382
00:31:28,583 --> 00:31:30,875
Then when it comes, I feel nothing.

383
00:31:31,375 --> 00:31:33,541
The one thing I feel
is I don't deserve it.

384
00:31:33,625 --> 00:31:36,833
- Of course you deserve it.
- What do I deserve? That's hubris.

385
00:31:36,916 --> 00:31:40,708
Your lack of humility is hubris, Silverio.
You always do the same thing.

386
00:31:41,208 --> 00:31:43,291
You work and hide in a corner for years,

387
00:31:43,375 --> 00:31:45,333
and when you show your work,
get recognition,

388
00:31:45,416 --> 00:31:48,708
you turn bitter, give up,
get depressed, and play the victim.

389
00:31:48,791 --> 00:31:50,875
- I know.
- It's exhausting, Silverio.

390
00:31:50,958 --> 00:31:53,517
There are many things
I'd like to change, but I can't.

391
00:31:53,541 --> 00:31:54,791
And believe me, I've tried.

392
00:31:54,875 --> 00:31:56,916
Your imposter syndrome
is pathetic.

393
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,041
You could have at least called.

394
00:31:59,125 --> 00:32:01,184
That's what Luis
and everyone else thinks.

395
00:32:01,208 --> 00:32:02,875
- They all know it.
- It's craziness.

396
00:32:02,958 --> 00:32:07,708
You inevitably turn into
what you think others think you are.

397
00:32:08,250 --> 00:32:11,333
All anyone's interested in
are the inanities of our personal life.

398
00:32:11,416 --> 00:32:14,041
Otherwise, nothing we do matters to them.

399
00:32:15,083 --> 00:32:17,375
And you're just figuring that out now?

400
00:32:17,458 --> 00:32:20,125
Not going was worse.
Luis is smearing you all over the web.

401
00:32:20,208 --> 00:32:23,250
Now it's not an audience laughing,
it's his three million followers.

402
00:32:23,333 --> 00:32:24,541
Look what he posted.

403
00:32:26,666 --> 00:32:28,166
I'm telling you,

404
00:32:28,250 --> 00:32:31,333
life is nothing
but a series of idiotic images.

405
00:32:31,416 --> 00:32:33,666
Exposure at any price.

406
00:32:33,750 --> 00:32:36,166
Repeating the same scenes of us shitting,

407
00:32:36,250 --> 00:32:39,291
wiping our asses, and being ridiculed.

408
00:32:39,375 --> 00:32:40,375
Quit it.

409
00:32:41,333 --> 00:32:43,791
- What?
- Your lips aren't moving.

410
00:32:43,875 --> 00:32:45,155
Does that bother you?

411
00:32:45,208 --> 00:32:47,666
- Yeah, quit it.
- Fine, I'll stop.

412
00:33:00,291 --> 00:33:01,416
Ow.

413
00:33:08,250 --> 00:33:11,291
Sooner or later, you'll have to call him.

414
00:33:11,375 --> 00:33:13,666
I know.

415
00:33:13,750 --> 00:33:16,375
How dare you leave him hanging
on a live TV show?

416
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:19,958
I'm going to Uruapan.

417
00:33:20,041 --> 00:33:21,083
When?

418
00:33:21,166 --> 00:33:23,250
I already told you. Tomorrow.

419
00:33:23,333 --> 00:33:27,041
It's the biggest fair,
and I can't let Lucero go alone.

420
00:33:27,125 --> 00:33:28,666
I've been gone too long.

421
00:33:41,250 --> 00:33:43,250
So...?

422
00:33:45,333 --> 00:33:48,250
It's got to be today, then.

423
00:33:48,333 --> 00:33:49,750
What choice do we have?

424
00:34:06,666 --> 00:34:07,666
Ah!

425
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:31,500
Lucía?

426
00:34:43,208 --> 00:34:44,250
Ah!

427
00:34:51,083 --> 00:34:53,041
I found you.

428
00:34:56,541 --> 00:34:57,583
Lucía?

429
00:36:17,750 --> 00:36:18,791
Hmm.

430
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,708
Will you marry me?

431
00:36:38,041 --> 00:36:40,250
Ow!

432
00:36:59,791 --> 00:37:00,916
Lucía?

433
00:37:02,291 --> 00:37:04,916
Lucía?

434
00:37:06,583 --> 00:37:09,291
Lucía?

435
00:37:51,166 --> 00:37:52,250
Dad...

436
00:37:53,875 --> 00:37:55,125
Dad.

437
00:37:55,791 --> 00:37:57,000
Lorenzo?

438
00:37:58,833 --> 00:37:59,958
What time is it?

439
00:38:00,750 --> 00:38:03,791
Late... Early. I don't know.

440
00:38:03,875 --> 00:38:05,916
You don't have to get up for a while.

441
00:38:06,958 --> 00:38:10,083
- I had a nice dream.
- What did you dream?

442
00:38:10,166 --> 00:38:13,833
You were chasing Mom around the apartment.

443
00:38:13,916 --> 00:38:15,666
You were both laughing.

444
00:38:15,750 --> 00:38:18,125
Mom had her boobies out.

445
00:38:18,208 --> 00:38:19,833
You saw us?

446
00:38:19,916 --> 00:38:22,041
No, it was just a dream.

447
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,541
But...

448
00:38:25,625 --> 00:38:27,791
I had a nightmare afterward.

449
00:38:27,875 --> 00:38:28,875
Uh-huh.

450
00:38:29,583 --> 00:38:33,791
I had a clear plastic tube

451
00:38:34,333 --> 00:38:37,666
in my mouth,
and it was blowing all this air,

452
00:38:37,750 --> 00:38:39,416
and I swelled up like a balloon.

453
00:38:41,083 --> 00:38:42,375
I couldn't breathe.

454
00:38:42,458 --> 00:38:45,041
It was blocking my throat.

455
00:38:45,583 --> 00:38:50,416
So... I pulled it out... with my hands.

456
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:53,333
Talk softer.
You're going to wake up your sister.

457
00:38:54,375 --> 00:38:56,333
She's not going to wake up.

458
00:38:56,416 --> 00:38:58,750
She's asleep, same as me.

459
00:38:58,833 --> 00:39:00,625
No.

460
00:39:00,708 --> 00:39:05,833
There were people
in the windows watching me,

461
00:39:05,916 --> 00:39:07,875
but they didn't say anything.

462
00:39:08,375 --> 00:39:11,583
- My brother Mateo was there too.
- Ah.

463
00:39:11,666 --> 00:39:15,958
And the people left,
and you sat down on my bed

464
00:39:16,625 --> 00:39:21,583
and looked at me with sad eyes.

465
00:39:22,375 --> 00:39:26,375
As you are looking at me now,
and that's what I'm dreaming.

466
00:39:26,458 --> 00:39:28,916
And so are you.

467
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:33,041
- But we're awake.
- No. I'm dreaming you.

468
00:39:33,125 --> 00:39:37,583
- You can't dream that you're dreaming.
- I can.

469
00:39:37,666 --> 00:39:39,625
- No.
- Yes, I can.

470
00:39:39,708 --> 00:39:42,166
Does this hurt?

471
00:39:42,250 --> 00:39:43,875
- No.
- Really?

472
00:39:43,958 --> 00:39:44,958
What about now?

473
00:39:45,041 --> 00:39:47,333
- No.
- And now?

474
00:39:47,416 --> 00:39:50,041
No, because I'm dreaming.

475
00:39:50,583 --> 00:39:52,125
Here's what we'll do, then.

476
00:39:52,208 --> 00:39:58,791
I'll cut off a lock of your hair
and put it in the nightstand.

477
00:39:58,875 --> 00:40:03,791
If you find it when you wake up tomorrow,
that means we're awake. Huh?

478
00:40:07,166 --> 00:40:08,875
Here we go.

479
00:40:19,458 --> 00:40:21,333
Good night.

480
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,208
Dad?

481
00:40:27,291 --> 00:40:28,291
Huh?

482
00:40:28,333 --> 00:40:29,625
Paco's sick.

483
00:40:32,750 --> 00:40:34,000
How do you know?

484
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:36,125
There are worms.

485
00:40:37,666 --> 00:40:39,083
Looks fine to me.

486
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,958
- Dad?
- Yes?

487
00:40:43,041 --> 00:40:45,000
Why's it called Los Angeles?

488
00:40:45,083 --> 00:40:46,291
I don't know.

489
00:40:46,375 --> 00:40:48,625
Are there angels in Los Angeles?

490
00:40:48,708 --> 00:40:51,166
Maybe. Get some sleep.

491
00:40:52,125 --> 00:40:53,791
- Dad?
- Eh?

492
00:40:54,291 --> 00:40:56,125
I don't want to leave them here.

493
00:40:56,208 --> 00:40:59,250
- Who?
- Paco, Guido, and Ernesto.

494
00:41:00,041 --> 00:41:01,750
I want us to take them.

495
00:41:02,291 --> 00:41:05,458
We'll talk about that tomorrow.
It's sleepy time now.

496
00:41:24,291 --> 00:41:25,750
Where were you?

497
00:41:27,625 --> 00:41:30,125
- You didn't close the door.
- It doesn't matter.

498
00:41:32,125 --> 00:41:33,583
They can't hear us.

499
00:42:15,625 --> 00:42:16,705
What are you doing?

500
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,791
He's back.

501
00:42:26,875 --> 00:42:28,041
Again?

502
00:42:34,208 --> 00:42:36,083
Push him back in.

503
00:42:45,291 --> 00:42:48,250
- What is it?
- He doesn't want to go.

504
00:42:49,250 --> 00:42:50,500
Wait.

505
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,625
He keeps coming back.

506
00:43:09,708 --> 00:43:11,916
I think he wanted
to tell us something this time.

507
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,291
He's a baby. What's he going to say?

508
00:43:14,375 --> 00:43:16,916
- He's trying to blame us.
- For what?

509
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,458
For the distance between us.

510
00:43:19,541 --> 00:43:21,666
For my selfishness.

511
00:43:22,166 --> 00:43:25,333
Remember how I blew up the night before?

512
00:43:25,416 --> 00:43:27,125
That's why we lost him.

513
00:43:27,208 --> 00:43:28,750
We didn't lose him.

514
00:43:28,833 --> 00:43:29,958
He chose not to come.

515
00:43:30,041 --> 00:43:31,166
Mm-hmm.

516
00:43:33,583 --> 00:43:37,375
Lorenzo told me
he saw Mateo in a dream.

517
00:43:38,333 --> 00:43:41,041
How could he dream of him
if Lorenzo was born a year later?

518
00:43:41,125 --> 00:43:43,333
It doesn't matter. They remember him.

519
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,708
We told the kids
over and over that Mateo wasn't here

520
00:43:46,791 --> 00:43:50,000
because he was flying around heaven
with his little wings.

521
00:43:50,541 --> 00:43:51,708
Remember?

522
00:43:52,583 --> 00:43:55,125
Mateo's just an idea now.

523
00:43:55,708 --> 00:43:57,083
He's not a person.

524
00:44:00,083 --> 00:44:01,875
People come and go.

525
00:44:03,208 --> 00:44:06,708
Ideas are what remain.

526
00:44:09,541 --> 00:44:11,583
- I don't remember his face.
- Mm.

527
00:44:11,666 --> 00:44:15,083
How can a child just transform
into a vague memory?

528
00:44:17,541 --> 00:44:19,125
He didn't give me the chance.

529
00:44:19,625 --> 00:44:20,958
To what?

530
00:44:21,041 --> 00:44:23,000
I know I can be a good father.

531
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:26,208
Poor little boy.

532
00:44:27,750 --> 00:44:31,375
If I saw that face of yours, I'd want
to crawl back inside my mother too.

533
00:44:32,750 --> 00:44:34,708
He must have been horrified
when he saw you.

534
00:44:34,791 --> 00:44:37,250
Poor Lorenzo and Camila
didn't have a choice.

535
00:44:37,333 --> 00:44:39,833
They have to look at this mug every day.

536
00:44:46,458 --> 00:44:49,250
We should let Mateo go.

537
00:45:00,041 --> 00:45:02,083
We could start
by taking him out of this room.

538
00:45:02,166 --> 00:45:03,166
Mm-hmm.

539
00:45:07,625 --> 00:45:09,875
We need to find a new place for him.

540
00:45:11,125 --> 00:45:12,791
Somewhere he can rest.

541
00:45:36,375 --> 00:45:38,291
Get up, Silverio.

542
00:45:39,541 --> 00:45:41,333
I'm making breakfast.

543
00:45:47,125 --> 00:45:48,885
<i>Who's coming?</i>

544
00:45:49,791 --> 00:45:51,166
Hello? Come on up.

545
00:45:51,791 --> 00:45:53,309
- It's Miguel.
- Miguel who?

546
00:45:53,333 --> 00:45:55,083
The hairdresser. He's been here before.

547
00:45:55,166 --> 00:45:57,416
- So early?
- They're picking us up at 7:00 p.m.

548
00:45:57,500 --> 00:46:00,416
It's 10:00 a.m. Will you spend nine hours
with your hair done up?

549
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:03,125
Yeah, for you. You should be grateful.

550
00:46:04,333 --> 00:46:09,166
You could have shut the door last night
before doing whatever you were doing.

551
00:46:09,250 --> 00:46:11,250
Good morning, Lorenzo. How'd you sleep?

552
00:46:11,333 --> 00:46:13,166
I barely fit
in the fucking bed.

553
00:46:13,250 --> 00:46:15,290
I'm making eggs.
Does anyone want some?

554
00:46:15,333 --> 00:46:16,416
No, I'm fine.

555
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:18,750
- Silverio? Eggs?
- Hmm?

556
00:46:21,541 --> 00:46:22,666
Who's that?

557
00:46:22,750 --> 00:46:23,916
Miguel.

558
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:25,958
- Miguel who?
- The hairdresser.

559
00:46:29,625 --> 00:46:30,708
Hola.

560
00:46:32,500 --> 00:46:35,333
Go into the living room.
I'll meet you there.

561
00:46:36,625 --> 00:46:39,333
Today's
the journalist union party.

562
00:46:39,416 --> 00:46:41,456
- I thought it was tomorrow.
- No, today.

563
00:46:43,125 --> 00:46:45,916
Thanks for being so nice with Miguel.

564
00:46:48,625 --> 00:46:51,541
Hey, what do you think of this?

565
00:46:54,083 --> 00:46:56,541
- What is it?
- My neighborhood. Narvarte.

566
00:46:56,625 --> 00:47:01,375
Martín wants us to start the video
with images and photos of my roots.

567
00:47:01,875 --> 00:47:04,125
I like the idea, but don't use that music.

568
00:47:05,250 --> 00:47:06,250
Boring.

569
00:47:06,333 --> 00:47:07,500
Why?

570
00:47:07,583 --> 00:47:09,291
Dad, who gives a shit about roots?

571
00:47:09,375 --> 00:47:11,000
We all come from somewhere.

572
00:47:11,083 --> 00:47:13,323
Not everyone knows where I'm from.

573
00:47:14,291 --> 00:47:19,125
But you're right.
If I don't care, who the fuck would?

574
00:47:19,208 --> 00:47:22,208
<i>Do you want to watch a movie?</i>

575
00:47:22,291 --> 00:47:25,000
<i>Moo... mie.</i>

576
00:47:25,083 --> 00:47:27,166
- What do you think of this?
- No!

577
00:47:27,250 --> 00:47:29,375
Who is that? Me?

578
00:47:29,458 --> 00:47:31,642
No, you can't put that on.

579
00:47:31,666 --> 00:47:32,958
It's embarrassing.

580
00:47:33,041 --> 00:47:34,333
I'll forbid you.

581
00:47:36,375 --> 00:47:39,125
Where'd you find that?
I haven't heard it in years.

582
00:47:39,208 --> 00:47:42,458
- We recorded it on the way to Zihuatanejo.
- Mom, stop.

583
00:47:42,541 --> 00:47:46,583
Your dad and I recorded everything
for the first... what? Twelve years?

584
00:47:46,666 --> 00:47:48,750
Every sound on every trip we took.

585
00:47:48,833 --> 00:47:50,500
We even recorded your farts.

586
00:47:50,583 --> 00:47:53,041
Wait, listen to this.

587
00:47:53,125 --> 00:47:54,208
Is that Japan?

588
00:47:54,291 --> 00:47:55,833
Incredible.

589
00:47:55,916 --> 00:47:58,642
- Please don't use that.
- Why not?

590
00:47:58,666 --> 00:48:00,375
It's our life soundtrack.

591
00:48:00,458 --> 00:48:03,291
Jesus, wash your hair.
What time is Camila coming?

592
00:48:03,375 --> 00:48:05,791
After lunch.
She's going to call me when she lands.

593
00:48:07,500 --> 00:48:09,083
Your chilaquiles are ready.

594
00:48:09,625 --> 00:48:12,250
You need to eat, Silverio.
You've got a long day.

595
00:48:13,708 --> 00:48:14,833
There are no eggs.

596
00:48:15,708 --> 00:48:18,500
- I'll be back. I'm going with Miguel.
- No eggs?

597
00:48:25,958 --> 00:48:27,208
What's that now?

598
00:48:27,291 --> 00:48:30,708
One of my strangest
and most emotional documentaries.

599
00:48:30,791 --> 00:48:33,333
On their way
to the US border to seek asylum,

600
00:48:33,416 --> 00:48:37,125
the people in the caravan stopped to pray
at the Cerro de las Piedras.

601
00:48:37,208 --> 00:48:39,833
And Our Lady of San Juan de los Lagos
appeared.

602
00:48:39,916 --> 00:48:43,166
There were many of them,
but they never made it to the border.

603
00:48:43,250 --> 00:48:44,833
When we tried to find them,

604
00:48:45,958 --> 00:48:49,166
all that was left was their clothes,
some belongings.

605
00:48:49,250 --> 00:48:51,125
No sign of the bodies.

606
00:48:51,625 --> 00:48:52,750
Some people told us

607
00:48:52,833 --> 00:48:55,791
that Our Lady of San Juan de los Lagos
came to take them away.

608
00:48:56,291 --> 00:48:59,625
Maybe it was an answer
to so much faith and despair.

609
00:49:00,500 --> 00:49:02,333
- And you believe it?
- No.

610
00:49:02,833 --> 00:49:05,250
I don't believe anything until I see it.

611
00:49:05,333 --> 00:49:07,916
But a documentarian
shouldn't believe or not believe.

612
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:11,500
He just needs to look
and know where to focus.

613
00:49:11,583 --> 00:49:15,375
And some of these people
told the camera incredible stories.

614
00:49:16,083 --> 00:49:19,500
- You're going to put that in your video?
- Yeah, I think so.

615
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,000
Why?

616
00:49:21,708 --> 00:49:25,250
Because that's a big part
of what we are, a country of immigrants.

617
00:49:25,333 --> 00:49:28,250
These people make sacrifices
and leave everything behind

618
00:49:28,333 --> 00:49:29,666
because here they're nothing.

619
00:49:29,750 --> 00:49:31,500
They're looking for something better.

620
00:49:32,125 --> 00:49:34,958
Cleaning the bathrooms
at an In-N-Out is better?

621
00:49:35,041 --> 00:49:37,291
Yeah, for many of them, it is.

622
00:49:37,791 --> 00:49:40,291
No. They go 'cause they want to.
We left too.

623
00:49:40,375 --> 00:49:41,458
No, it's not the same.

624
00:49:41,541 --> 00:49:43,341
Why not?
We left everything here.

625
00:49:43,375 --> 00:49:45,333
Yeah,
but they don't have a choice.

626
00:49:45,416 --> 00:49:46,916
They leave because there's no work.

627
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,041
Here, people kill them, extort them.

628
00:49:49,125 --> 00:49:52,916
We didn't lack anything.
We're first-class immigrants.

629
00:49:55,625 --> 00:49:57,000
I don't get it.

630
00:49:57,083 --> 00:49:58,208
What?

631
00:49:58,291 --> 00:50:00,166
How is this representing you?

632
00:50:00,250 --> 00:50:02,666
Why use these people
to talk about your life

633
00:50:02,750 --> 00:50:05,333
if you don't know
who they are or how they live?

634
00:50:05,416 --> 00:50:07,791
You shoot them, you interview them,

635
00:50:07,875 --> 00:50:11,416
you even make money with them,
but you don't know them at all.

636
00:50:11,500 --> 00:50:13,958
Who made you king shit?

637
00:50:14,041 --> 00:50:15,041
What?

638
00:50:15,125 --> 00:50:18,416
You're 17 years old,
and you act like you know everything.

639
00:50:18,500 --> 00:50:21,500
When I was your age,
I was on a fishing boat, working.

640
00:50:21,583 --> 00:50:23,583
Here you go.
The stupid boat. C'mon.

641
00:50:24,083 --> 00:50:26,642
That's what happens
when you give someone everything

642
00:50:26,666 --> 00:50:28,458
and they never learn shit.

643
00:50:28,541 --> 00:50:31,708
You don't appreciate anything
because you've never worked for it.

644
00:50:31,791 --> 00:50:34,666
You've got no responsibilities.

645
00:50:34,750 --> 00:50:36,291
It's your fault.

646
00:50:36,375 --> 00:50:37,375
What?

647
00:50:37,458 --> 00:50:39,098
You brought me to the world.

648
00:50:39,125 --> 00:50:42,708
No one told me.
No one ever warns you about it.

649
00:50:42,791 --> 00:50:47,208
Your kid becomes a teenager,
and it's a full-time job.

650
00:50:47,291 --> 00:50:49,750
Everything's a fucking problem.

651
00:50:50,333 --> 00:50:52,541
Wow,
I didn't ask you to bring me here.

652
00:50:56,125 --> 00:50:58,250
You realize that, right?

653
00:50:58,333 --> 00:51:02,375
That you don't respect anyone or anything.
Not even your parents.

654
00:51:02,458 --> 00:51:05,041
And those people
whose lives you find depressing,

655
00:51:05,125 --> 00:51:09,791
at least they respect who they are,
their ancestors, their customs...

656
00:51:09,875 --> 00:51:12,875
Their rituals existed way before the USA,

657
00:51:12,958 --> 00:51:17,083
a country that only respects money,
learned to walk.

658
00:51:18,083 --> 00:51:21,958
You don't know them.
And that's the truth. It's not your truth.

659
00:51:22,041 --> 00:51:24,875
No. But how can you know
if I appreciate things or not?

660
00:51:24,958 --> 00:51:27,625
I do appreciate things
but not the ones you do.

661
00:51:27,708 --> 00:51:29,666
And yes, things cost me a lot.

662
00:51:29,750 --> 00:51:32,583
Even now, expressing my feelings,
which you insist I should do.

663
00:51:32,666 --> 00:51:33,746
Yes, I insist.

664
00:51:33,791 --> 00:51:35,625
It costs me a lot,
but I do it.

665
00:51:35,708 --> 00:51:39,083
Just, they're not the feelings
you would like, so they must not be true.

666
00:51:39,166 --> 00:51:41,006
Speak Spanish.

667
00:51:41,083 --> 00:51:42,083
Why?

668
00:51:42,166 --> 00:51:45,375
Because we're in Mexico,
we're Mexicans, and we speak Spanish!

669
00:51:45,458 --> 00:51:47,250
You couldn't pick up the phone?

670
00:51:47,750 --> 00:51:48,791
Hello?

671
00:51:49,375 --> 00:51:51,015
You always do the same, Dad.

672
00:51:51,083 --> 00:51:54,416
Every time we come to Mexico,
you try to convince me of how cool,

673
00:51:54,500 --> 00:51:57,041
deep, spiritual, and cultural it is.

674
00:51:57,125 --> 00:51:58,333
But it's not.

675
00:51:58,416 --> 00:52:00,333
People suffer and starve.

676
00:52:01,166 --> 00:52:02,166
Stop.

677
00:52:02,208 --> 00:52:03,808
If you love Mexico so much,

678
00:52:03,875 --> 00:52:05,625
why'd you take Camila
and me to the States?

679
00:52:05,708 --> 00:52:07,708
- Why did you make us grow up there?
- Bye.

680
00:52:08,458 --> 00:52:09,698
That was Reynolds.

681
00:52:09,750 --> 00:52:13,333
He said the award rehearsal
is next Tuesday at 5:00 p.m. LA time.

682
00:52:15,250 --> 00:52:17,875
Congratulations.
You're the big shit, Dad.

683
00:52:17,958 --> 00:52:21,916
That country that only respects
for money is going to give you an award.

684
00:52:22,500 --> 00:52:24,375
And you're going to go get it.

685
00:52:24,458 --> 00:52:27,000
I'm just looking forward
to hear what you will say.

686
00:52:30,625 --> 00:52:33,517
Our Lady of Los Lagos
didn't make those immigrants disappear.

687
00:52:33,541 --> 00:52:36,250
They disappeared
because they fucking died.

688
00:52:49,583 --> 00:52:53,875
- You know you're no different, right?
- What?

689
00:52:53,958 --> 00:52:56,708
If someone praises Mexico,
you lecture them about how it is.

690
00:52:56,791 --> 00:53:02,583
If a gringo criticizes it, you recite why
it's the most fascinating gastronomical,

691
00:53:02,666 --> 00:53:06,416
anthropological, and cultural experiment
the world's ever known.

692
00:53:06,500 --> 00:53:09,875
Lucía, all I'm saying
is you have to leave Mexico

693
00:53:09,958 --> 00:53:13,208
to realize what you've lost
and what they've stolen and destroyed.

694
00:53:13,291 --> 00:53:16,041
Lorenzo was trying to tell you
he thinks it's a poor country.

695
00:53:16,125 --> 00:53:18,541
It's not poor, it's unequal.
There's a difference.

696
00:53:18,625 --> 00:53:20,750
Perfect. You win again, Silverio.

697
00:53:21,333 --> 00:53:24,458
Your justifications are faultless.
As always.

698
00:53:24,958 --> 00:53:27,000
When's the last time
you strolled in the city?

699
00:53:30,625 --> 00:53:32,208
Let it go.

700
00:53:34,125 --> 00:53:35,750
You really want another chance?

701
00:53:36,250 --> 00:53:38,333
- At what?
- At being a good father.

702
00:53:39,583 --> 00:53:41,958
- Yeah.
- Well, you've got one.

703
00:53:42,041 --> 00:53:44,125
With Lorenzo and Camila.
They're still young.

704
00:53:44,208 --> 00:53:46,375
You just need to learn to be present.

705
00:53:46,458 --> 00:53:48,333
I'm here, Lucía.

706
00:53:48,416 --> 00:53:51,833
Yeah, with your laptop,
working on your fucking award video.

707
00:53:55,916 --> 00:53:57,958
I'm going
to pick up the clothes!

708
00:55:05,541 --> 00:55:07,461
This desert is a killing machine.

709
00:55:07,958 --> 00:55:11,958
If the heat and mountains don't kill you,
a snake or a scorpion will.

710
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:14,333
Where are you going?

711
00:55:14,416 --> 00:55:15,958
Arizona.

712
00:55:16,708 --> 00:55:18,375
We'll cross through Nogales.

713
00:55:19,291 --> 00:55:22,333
We're taking the god Centéotl
so they'll bring him back to life.

714
00:55:22,416 --> 00:55:24,625
What happened
to the god Centéotl?

715
00:55:24,708 --> 00:55:26,000
He died.

716
00:55:26,083 --> 00:55:28,666
There's no corn left.
We're starving to death.

717
00:55:28,750 --> 00:55:31,208
You don't have to die
to go to hell.

718
00:55:31,708 --> 00:55:34,083
Just go to Chalchihuites,
and you'll find it.

719
00:55:34,166 --> 00:55:37,875
There, in our village,
everything is death, hunger, violence.

720
00:55:39,791 --> 00:55:41,541
Are there more people with you?

721
00:55:41,625 --> 00:55:43,541
Our grandkids.

722
00:55:43,625 --> 00:55:45,666
Back there,
they've got Centéotl.

723
00:55:46,166 --> 00:55:48,958
My two kids were killed.

724
00:55:49,041 --> 00:55:51,833
So we're going north to meet my brother.

725
00:55:53,791 --> 00:55:54,833
Thanks.

726
00:55:54,916 --> 00:55:56,041
Safe travels.

727
00:56:42,125 --> 00:56:43,833
Do you have enough water?

728
00:56:43,916 --> 00:56:46,583
There she is! They found her!

729
00:57:00,708 --> 00:57:05,208
Listen to my sister! She's on the phone!

730
00:57:05,291 --> 00:57:12,208
She says Our Lady of Los Lagos appeared
to them on the Cerro de las Piedras.

731
00:57:24,166 --> 00:57:29,000
As they reached the top of the hill,
night turned to day.

732
00:57:29,083 --> 00:57:33,041
And then she appeared!
She's blessing them!

733
00:58:47,875 --> 00:58:49,208
Silverio...

734
00:58:52,375 --> 00:58:53,833
Silverio...

735
00:58:57,458 --> 00:58:59,458
Silverio, how are you feeling?

736
00:59:02,625 --> 00:59:04,333
You seem tired.

737
00:59:07,750 --> 00:59:08,958
Peaceful.

738
00:59:12,125 --> 00:59:13,166
Tranquil.

739
00:59:19,333 --> 00:59:24,625
<i>♪ I got sunshine in my stomach ♪</i>

740
00:59:26,041 --> 00:59:31,583
<i>♪ Like I just rocked my baby to sleep ♪</i>

741
00:59:32,750 --> 00:59:37,250
<i>♪ I got sunshine in my stomach ♪</i>

742
00:59:39,291 --> 00:59:45,708
<i>♪ But I can't keep me

743
00:59:46,250 --> 00:59:51,458
<i>♪ Sleep, deep in the deep ♪</i>

744
00:59:54,541 --> 00:59:56,166
<i>You're not scared?</i>

745
00:59:59,083 --> 01:00:00,583
<i>Scared of what?</i>

746
01:00:02,208 --> 01:00:03,416
<i>Of dying.</i>

747
01:00:09,958 --> 01:00:12,791
<i>For you people,
death is a Christian affair.</i>

748
01:00:13,291 --> 01:00:17,083
<i>A comfortable heart attack in bed.</i>

749
01:00:18,208 --> 01:00:20,000
<i>For us, it's our daily bread.</i>

750
01:00:20,083 --> 01:00:22,041
<i>Getting tossed in a mass grave.</i>

751
01:00:22,541 --> 01:00:25,791
<i>Here in jail,
no one can come in and kill me.</i>

752
01:00:25,875 --> 01:00:28,750
<i>But I can have you killed out there.</i>

753
01:00:29,250 --> 01:00:31,750
<i>I used to be poor, invisible.</i>

754
01:00:31,833 --> 01:00:33,916
<i>You all ignored me for decades.</i>

755
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:38,500
<i>Now... I've got you by the balls.</i>

756
01:00:42,416 --> 01:00:44,416
<i>We're walking bombs.</i>

757
01:00:44,500 --> 01:00:47,666
<i>There are millions of us
in the poor villages.</i>

758
01:00:47,750 --> 01:00:51,041
<i>We stand at the heart of the paradox.</i>

759
01:00:51,125 --> 01:00:53,000
<i>We're a new species.</i>

760
01:00:53,083 --> 01:00:55,958
<i>A different beast. We're not like you.</i>

761
01:00:56,041 --> 01:00:57,791
<i>What should we have done?</i>

762
01:00:58,875 --> 01:01:02,958
<i>You intellectuals</i>

763
01:01:03,708 --> 01:01:07,250
<i>love running your mouths
about class struggle, the marginalized.</i>

764
01:01:07,333 --> 01:01:11,333
<i>Then we show up.</i>

765
01:01:15,625 --> 01:01:19,750
<i>The proletariat, the dejected,
the exploited, all that's old news.</i>

766
01:01:20,333 --> 01:01:22,958
<i>There's something new growing out there,</i>

767
01:01:23,041 --> 01:01:27,083
<i>raised in the mud,
schooled on the purest illiteracy,</i>

768
01:01:28,083 --> 01:01:30,875
<i>and it lurks like an alien monster
in the corners of the city.</i>

769
01:01:31,375 --> 01:01:33,750
<i>You're looking at
what you might call "post-poverty."</i>

770
01:01:33,833 --> 01:01:37,375
<i>What changed out in the slums?</i>

771
01:01:37,458 --> 01:01:40,791
<i>Cash. We've got millions,</i>

772
01:01:40,875 --> 01:01:43,666
<i>and you are all bankrupt
and are led by incompetents.</i>

773
01:01:43,750 --> 01:01:45,791
Damn straight!

774
01:01:45,875 --> 01:01:46,916
<i>Get it?</i>

775
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:50,125
<i>Our methods are agile,</i>

776
01:01:50,208 --> 01:01:52,541
<i>you're slow and bureaucratic.</i>

777
01:01:52,625 --> 01:01:56,166
<i>We don't fear death, you're dying of fear.</i>

778
01:01:56,250 --> 01:01:57,958
<i>We pack real guns,</i>

779
01:01:58,041 --> 01:02:00,750
<i>you pack .38s.</i>

780
01:02:01,250 --> 01:02:04,791
<i>We attack, you defend.</i>

781
01:02:04,875 --> 01:02:09,541
<i>You say "human rights," we say "no mercy."</i>

782
01:02:10,041 --> 01:02:14,750
<i>You've made us TV stars,
we've made you clowns.</i>

783
01:02:14,833 --> 01:02:19,750
<i>The slum dwellers help us,
out of love or fear, but they hate you.</i>

784
01:02:20,375 --> 01:02:24,500
<i>You're regional, provincial,
nationalist, corrupt.</i>

785
01:02:24,583 --> 01:02:27,958
<i>We've got 50 million
captive gringo junkies.</i>

786
01:02:28,041 --> 01:02:30,083
<i>Our guns come from overseas,
from the Yankees.</i>

787
01:02:30,166 --> 01:02:31,333
<i>We're global.</i>

788
01:02:31,416 --> 01:02:35,083
<i>We don't forget about you.
You're our customers.</i>

789
01:02:35,583 --> 01:02:39,750
<i>You forget us as soon as the shock
of the violence we provoke has passed.</i>

790
01:02:44,291 --> 01:02:48,083
HONORARY MEMBER
OF THE MEXICAN JOURNALISTS UNION

791
01:03:12,958 --> 01:03:14,833
CALIFORNIA DANCING CLUB

792
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:21,583
How's it feel being
in front of the camera?

793
01:03:21,666 --> 01:03:23,625
What's going
through your head now?

794
01:03:23,708 --> 01:03:28,125
If I told you what I was thinking
right now, I'd get locked up for life.

795
01:03:28,208 --> 01:03:30,500
Do you feel more gringo or more Mexican?

796
01:03:31,125 --> 01:03:33,875
My nationality is no nationality.

797
01:03:33,958 --> 01:03:36,250
Do you understand
what's going on in your country?

798
01:03:36,333 --> 01:03:39,041
No. Honestly, I can't understand
my country.

799
01:03:39,125 --> 01:03:40,500
All I can do is love it.

800
01:03:40,583 --> 01:03:43,625
How should we respond to
the most dangerous cartel on the planet?

801
01:03:43,708 --> 01:03:46,125
The corporate cartel of the USA.

802
01:03:46,208 --> 01:03:47,583
Silverio!

803
01:03:47,666 --> 01:03:49,125
Will you take a photo with me?

804
01:03:49,208 --> 01:03:51,333
Sure. Thanks.

805
01:03:51,416 --> 01:03:54,916
- Thanks.
- I love your work.

806
01:03:55,666 --> 01:03:58,708
- Thanks.
- I love your work too.

807
01:03:58,791 --> 01:04:00,916
Thank you. Good night.

808
01:04:05,958 --> 01:04:06,875
Hey!

809
01:04:14,416 --> 01:04:18,083
That arrogant son of a bitch.

810
01:04:18,166 --> 01:04:24,041
- No mezcal around?
- I saw a waiter serving some over there.

811
01:04:25,416 --> 01:04:26,416
Dad!

812
01:04:26,500 --> 01:04:29,500
Darling! It's good to see you!

813
01:04:29,583 --> 01:04:33,125
The flight was delayed.
It won't stop snowing in Boston.

814
01:04:35,416 --> 01:04:36,708
Ah!

815
01:04:36,791 --> 01:04:38,125
What's up, bro?

816
01:04:39,750 --> 01:04:42,291
So this whole party's
just for you?

817
01:04:42,375 --> 01:04:43,583
So it seems.

818
01:04:43,666 --> 01:04:46,833
Horrible. Come on,
my aunts and uncles are over there.

819
01:04:46,916 --> 01:04:49,958
- The whole family's waiting for you.
- Where are they?

820
01:05:03,958 --> 01:05:07,166
- Where are they?
- In the back, Mom.

821
01:05:27,916 --> 01:05:29,333
Brother-in-law!

822
01:05:29,416 --> 01:05:32,916
Who paid for this blowout?
Thought you journalists were broke.

823
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:36,000
No matter if they treat you nice or bad,
you bitch anyway.

824
01:05:36,083 --> 01:05:39,041
- Have a fucking drink. They're free.
- In that case...

825
01:05:39,125 --> 01:05:42,666
- My darky!
- My dear sister!

826
01:05:42,750 --> 01:05:49,125
- I loved the documentary. So much.
- So good. But a little whiny, no?

827
01:05:49,208 --> 01:05:50,375
And a little long.

828
01:05:50,458 --> 01:05:53,666
It's 90 minutes long, you lazy bum.

829
01:05:53,750 --> 01:05:57,291
No, no, no, no! Oh, wow!

830
01:05:57,375 --> 01:06:00,916
- The jewel in the crown.
- I clean up pretty good, don't I?

831
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:02,875
Maybe you can stick me in your next film,

832
01:06:02,958 --> 01:06:05,541
even just in the corner
as an extra.

833
01:06:05,625 --> 01:06:07,083
Congratulations.

834
01:06:17,208 --> 01:06:20,291
You finally made it, you bastard!

835
01:06:21,625 --> 01:06:23,000
I missed you guys.

836
01:06:23,083 --> 01:06:24,500
It's a miracle, <i>cabrón</i>!

837
01:06:24,583 --> 01:06:28,291
My daughter got married, you bailed.
My father died, you bailed.

838
01:06:28,375 --> 01:06:30,708
But they throw a party for you,
and here you are.

839
01:06:30,791 --> 01:06:34,291
You think his lordship
will come to our bullshit get-togethers?

840
01:06:34,375 --> 01:06:36,875
Good to see you. Congratulations, <i>cabrón.</i>

841
01:06:36,958 --> 01:06:40,375
They won't leave you alone.
They're disguised complaints, brother.

842
01:06:40,458 --> 01:06:42,666
Who'd have thought you'd get an award

843
01:06:42,750 --> 01:06:45,708
from the same bastards
you've been criticizing your whole life?

844
01:06:45,791 --> 01:06:47,125
I know, right?

845
01:06:47,208 --> 01:06:49,500
- You've got something on your nose.
- What?

846
01:06:49,583 --> 01:06:51,916
Ah.

847
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:56,375
A piece of shit
from kissing all that gringo ass.

848
01:06:56,458 --> 01:06:59,875
Honestly, considering you're
such a dumbass, you surprised all of us.

849
01:06:59,958 --> 01:07:02,250
Piss off.

850
01:07:02,333 --> 01:07:05,916
Seriously, though. I really admire you.

851
01:07:07,083 --> 01:07:08,750
Thanks. I admire you too.

852
01:07:10,875 --> 01:07:15,041
- Keep your feet on the ground, eh?
- How about you lift your fat ass off it?

853
01:07:15,125 --> 01:07:18,083
He fucking got me!
He's calling me a loser, <i>cabrón</i>.

854
01:07:18,166 --> 01:07:21,291
Go back to the other side
and kiss some more Mexican ass.

855
01:07:21,375 --> 01:07:24,000
Don't fuck with him.
You'll wind up in the papers.

856
01:07:24,083 --> 01:07:26,333
Look who's coming! Pablo Galindo!

857
01:07:26,416 --> 01:07:28,041
Pablito, run and hide, <i>cabrón.</i>

858
01:07:28,125 --> 01:07:32,750
You don't want word getting out
about your beach mansion in Baja.

859
01:07:32,833 --> 01:07:35,041
I couldn't give a fuck, pal.

860
01:07:37,416 --> 01:07:38,916
Here's to Silverio.

861
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:41,083
A toast!

862
01:07:44,208 --> 01:07:48,000
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

863
01:07:52,541 --> 01:07:56,541
Give me a cigarette.
These people are driving me nuts.

864
01:07:56,625 --> 01:07:58,875
- Who is that?
- Where?

865
01:07:58,958 --> 01:08:02,041
Over there. The art critic.
I forgot his name.

866
01:08:02,125 --> 01:08:03,625
As usual.

867
01:08:16,541 --> 01:08:18,000
Hey, Luis.

868
01:08:18,750 --> 01:08:20,708
Thanks for showing up.

869
01:08:20,791 --> 01:08:23,500
Thanks for not inviting me, <i>cabrón.</i>

870
01:08:23,583 --> 01:08:24,958
Lucía, how are you?

871
01:08:25,041 --> 01:08:27,625
- Good, Luis. So nice you came.
- Thanks.

872
01:08:27,708 --> 01:08:30,708
- I'm going for a mezcal. Want anything?
- No, thanks. I'm good.

873
01:08:30,791 --> 01:08:32,500
- Mezcal, thanks.
- Okay.

874
01:08:34,375 --> 01:08:37,833
The illustrious Don Silverio Gama.

875
01:08:37,916 --> 01:08:40,166
Journalist, documentarian/artist.

876
01:08:40,250 --> 01:08:43,208
The icon looking down on us
from his pedestal.

877
01:08:43,291 --> 01:08:45,291
Who neither shows up for his interview,

878
01:08:45,375 --> 01:08:48,541
nor cares about the efforts made
by an entire live TV crew.

879
01:08:48,625 --> 01:08:49,666
I'm sorry, Luis.

880
01:08:49,750 --> 01:08:54,291
'Cause to you,
everyone at this party is just a peon.

881
01:08:54,375 --> 01:08:57,666
Yeah, each and every one of us.
But you're wrong.

882
01:08:57,750 --> 01:09:00,916
Those of us who didn't hightail it
out of Mexico, we're martyrs.

883
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:05,375
- Luis, I swear...
- Ditching me wasn't enough, Silverio?

884
01:09:05,458 --> 01:09:08,166
I've been trying to find you for days.

885
01:09:08,250 --> 01:09:09,500
Why didn't you face me?

886
01:09:09,583 --> 01:09:11,291
I know. I'm sorry, I am.

887
01:09:11,375 --> 01:09:12,500
Why?

888
01:09:12,583 --> 01:09:17,208
Uh, Luis, I'm thankful
you invited me on your show, but...

889
01:09:17,875 --> 01:09:19,041
But what, <i>cabrón</i>?

890
01:09:20,125 --> 01:09:22,791
I just couldn't do it.

891
01:09:23,750 --> 01:09:27,625
- My show isn't good enough for you?
- Don't do this to me. Please.

892
01:09:27,708 --> 01:09:29,208
You and I are friends.

893
01:09:29,291 --> 01:09:30,791
Exactly, <i>cabrón</i>.

894
01:09:30,875 --> 01:09:33,458
And when friends call, you pick up.

895
01:09:33,541 --> 01:09:35,708
You shoot straight. Especially you.

896
01:09:35,791 --> 01:09:40,000
Mr. Truth, Mr. Critical Thinking.

897
01:09:40,500 --> 01:09:42,000
Give me a break.

898
01:09:43,791 --> 01:09:45,750
Come on, please.

899
01:09:55,500 --> 01:09:58,541
You've trashed my work publicly
thousands of times.

900
01:09:59,625 --> 01:10:03,000
Luis, why did you invite me?

901
01:10:03,583 --> 01:10:05,041
What do you mean, "why?"

902
01:10:05,125 --> 01:10:08,250
If you hate my work so much, why bother?

903
01:10:08,333 --> 01:10:10,375
I'm a journalist, not your fan or lackey.

904
01:10:10,458 --> 01:10:14,166
You're my friend, and I think
that's what you've come to proclaim.

905
01:10:14,250 --> 01:10:18,208
But if you were, you'd say
the truth to my face, not publicly.

906
01:10:18,291 --> 01:10:19,916
- You want the truth?
- I do.

907
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:22,125
Want to know
what I think of your documentary?

908
01:10:22,208 --> 01:10:24,000
Shoot. I can handle it.

909
01:10:24,083 --> 01:10:27,708
I think it's pretentious.
It's pointlessly oneiric.

910
01:10:27,791 --> 01:10:31,250
It's oneiric to cover up
for your mediocre writing.

911
01:10:31,333 --> 01:10:33,791
It's a mishmash of pointless scenes.

912
01:10:33,875 --> 01:10:37,666
Half the time, I wanted to crack up,
the other half I was dying of boredom.

913
01:10:37,750 --> 01:10:42,541
It's supposed to be metaphorical,
but it lacks poetic inspiration.

914
01:10:42,625 --> 01:10:47,000
It feels stolen. Plagiarized.
And you barely covered your tracks.

915
01:10:47,083 --> 01:10:50,291
What's so funny? It's banal, random.

916
01:10:50,375 --> 01:10:53,666
That shit with the soldiers
in blond wigs at Chapultepec Castle...

917
01:10:53,750 --> 01:10:56,041
Come on.

918
01:10:56,125 --> 01:10:59,750
First the guy's
on the train with some axolotls.

919
01:10:59,833 --> 01:11:02,750
Then bang, he's in his apartment
in the middle of the desert.

920
01:11:02,833 --> 01:11:05,875
Just because. 'Cause that's
how it popped into your head.

921
01:11:05,958 --> 01:11:09,333
Why there and not,
say, the Estadio Azteca?

922
01:11:09,416 --> 01:11:12,541
- Why not?
- Because life isn't like that, man.

923
01:11:12,625 --> 01:11:15,541
There's chronology.
Order. Causes and consequences.

924
01:11:15,625 --> 01:11:19,041
It's a docufiction, Luis.
Humor's serious business.

925
01:11:19,125 --> 01:11:22,791
Unintentional humor because you broke
every rule of good journalism.

926
01:11:22,875 --> 01:11:28,041
Fuck objectivity, neutrality,
history, truth.

927
01:11:28,125 --> 01:11:30,291
You couldn't check your ego.

928
01:11:30,375 --> 01:11:33,833
You even put yourself
in the movie, <i>cabrón</i>.

929
01:11:34,583 --> 01:11:36,875
You used historical figures
to talk about yourself.

930
01:11:36,958 --> 01:11:39,291
Who the fuck do you think you are?

931
01:11:39,791 --> 01:11:41,208
Answer, <i>cabrón</i>!

932
01:11:41,875 --> 01:11:44,333
Gimme a smoke.

933
01:11:51,208 --> 01:11:55,416
If you want to talk about your life,
tell it straight.

934
01:11:55,500 --> 01:11:56,875
Write an autobiography.

935
01:11:56,958 --> 01:12:00,583
Screw that. Nothing could be more boring
or banal than my life.

936
01:12:00,666 --> 01:12:03,125
What the fuck were you trying to say?

937
01:12:05,958 --> 01:12:08,541
You talk about your private life
or the cosmos,

938
01:12:08,625 --> 01:12:10,708
your personal tragedies or politics.

939
01:12:10,791 --> 01:12:14,083
What was that? A memoir, a farce, or...

940
01:12:14,166 --> 01:12:17,708
I'm all those things
and none of them, Luis.

941
01:12:17,791 --> 01:12:20,541
You sound like an artiste.

942
01:12:20,625 --> 01:12:23,250
Maybe it's just a chronicle
of uncertainties.

943
01:12:23,333 --> 01:12:24,500
That suits me fine.

944
01:12:24,583 --> 01:12:28,458
You've got to be crazy.
A chronicle of uncertainties? Fuck.

945
01:12:28,541 --> 01:12:31,541
Luis, I'm not interested
in talking about my life.

946
01:12:31,625 --> 01:12:35,291
Memory lacks truth.
All it has is emotional conviction.

947
01:12:35,958 --> 01:12:40,208
Anyway, I'm tired of saying
what I think and not what I feel.

948
01:12:40,291 --> 01:12:41,333
You're a journalist.

949
01:12:41,416 --> 01:12:44,500
You have to say what you think
and think what you say.

950
01:12:44,583 --> 01:12:46,541
At least you used to have solid ideas.

951
01:12:46,625 --> 01:12:52,791
What good are solid ideas
in a world that slips through our fingers?

952
01:12:52,875 --> 01:12:58,333
You're getting old, buddy.
A clear case of a midlife crisis.

953
01:12:58,416 --> 01:13:01,750
Could be.

954
01:13:02,250 --> 01:13:07,708
At this age, life goes so fast,
it starts to feel like a convulsion.

955
01:13:09,583 --> 01:13:15,416
A tumult of images, memories, slivers,

956
01:13:15,500 --> 01:13:17,708
all knotted together.

957
01:13:24,791 --> 01:13:28,375
How beautiful this ugly city is,
don't you think?

958
01:13:28,458 --> 01:13:32,875
For fuck's sake, man.

959
01:13:32,958 --> 01:13:35,583
- Sorry to interrupt.
- No problem.

960
01:13:35,666 --> 01:13:37,750
Luis Valdivia, can we take a photo?

961
01:13:37,833 --> 01:13:39,500
- Of course.
- Thank you.

962
01:13:39,583 --> 01:13:41,708
- In the middle, please.
- Yes.

963
01:13:42,583 --> 01:13:44,416
Perfect.

964
01:13:45,541 --> 01:13:46,833
One, two...

965
01:13:48,791 --> 01:13:49,791
Excellent.

966
01:13:49,875 --> 01:13:53,375
Thanks so much.
We're huge fans of your show.

967
01:13:53,458 --> 01:13:56,208
Thanks. Good night.

968
01:13:57,208 --> 01:13:59,083
Just don't forget, Silverio,

969
01:14:00,541 --> 01:14:03,250
where you come from
or who you were before you met me.

970
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:06,625
What are you laughing at, dickhead?

971
01:14:09,041 --> 01:14:11,541
At your fucking certainties, <i>cabrón</i>.

972
01:14:11,625 --> 01:14:14,666
Categorical, like your journalism.

973
01:14:14,750 --> 01:14:18,291
Blinkered, like your acumen.

974
01:14:18,375 --> 01:14:21,791
As mediocre as your artistic aptitudes.

975
01:14:21,875 --> 01:14:25,125
I'm laughing at your short-sighted,
flag-waving nationalism.

976
01:14:25,208 --> 01:14:26,583
Your provincialism.

977
01:14:26,666 --> 01:14:30,041
How you bow down to an industry
devoted to public humiliation

978
01:14:30,125 --> 01:14:32,000
and online lynching.

979
01:14:32,083 --> 01:14:34,625
The clicks that tell us what to believe.

980
01:14:34,708 --> 01:14:37,500
The new gold mine for corporations.

981
01:14:37,583 --> 01:14:42,833
Luis, I am who I am because I got away
from you, from here, from TV.

982
01:14:43,333 --> 01:14:44,375
Look at you.

983
01:14:45,083 --> 01:14:46,291
Vulgar.

984
01:14:46,958 --> 01:14:50,333
Spiteful. And proud of it to boot.

985
01:14:51,666 --> 01:14:53,125
You're a fake.

986
01:14:53,208 --> 01:14:57,375
Scrounging for likes on your socials.
Strolling around with your goons.

987
01:14:57,458 --> 01:15:02,125
Rubbing elbows with the president,
pushing faddish ideologies and idiocies.

988
01:15:02,208 --> 01:15:06,166
You're the perfect image
of today's journalist, Luis.

989
01:15:06,250 --> 01:15:08,791
An entertainer, an opinion peddler.

990
01:15:09,541 --> 01:15:13,000
It's people like you
who've left us without truth.

991
01:15:13,583 --> 01:15:16,708
Beat it. Go dance.
I'm tired of hearing you.

992
01:15:18,125 --> 01:15:19,916
Tough men don't dance.

993
01:15:20,416 --> 01:15:22,976
That's my father's line,
and I forbid you to use it.

994
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:24,666
Go, I'm sick of hearing your voice.

995
01:15:37,291 --> 01:15:39,958
Mm.

996
01:15:41,958 --> 01:15:43,916
I told you I'm sick of your voice.

997
01:15:58,833 --> 01:16:01,833
- Finally.
- How was it with Luis?

998
01:16:04,083 --> 01:16:05,250
Tell me.

999
01:16:09,500 --> 01:16:11,041
Marvelous.

1000
01:16:11,125 --> 01:16:12,458
Seriously?

1001
01:16:20,916 --> 01:16:22,666
Come on. Let's dance.

1002
01:16:45,291 --> 01:16:47,208
- Let's have a mezcal.
- Let's dance instead.

1003
01:16:47,291 --> 01:16:48,375
Please.

1004
01:16:48,458 --> 01:16:50,333
- No, wait!
- Let's dance.

1005
01:16:50,416 --> 01:16:51,500
I don't feel like it.

1006
01:16:51,583 --> 01:16:54,333
There are 100 guys here
who'd kill for a dance with me.

1007
01:16:59,916 --> 01:17:03,000
Oh,
it seems the jungle's calling.

1008
01:18:14,916 --> 01:18:16,625
- Hey!
- Hey!

1009
01:18:20,708 --> 01:18:22,041
Come on!

1010
01:18:25,083 --> 01:18:26,416
Dad!

1011
01:18:27,125 --> 01:18:28,500
You recognize this song?

1012
01:18:28,583 --> 01:18:30,291
- Which one?
- This one.

1013
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:49,958
- Silverio!
- Cloe!

1014
01:19:47,708 --> 01:19:50,083

My apologies.
The festivities will continue in a moment.

1034
01:21:14,083 --> 01:21:17,208
Before we invite up our guest of honor,

1035
01:21:17,291 --> 01:21:20,541
we'll hear a few words

1036
01:21:20,625 --> 01:21:24,083
from our esteemed
secretary of the interior,

1037
01:21:24,166 --> 01:21:27,375
Mr. Siniestro Quiñones.

1038
01:21:27,458 --> 01:21:29,166
Let's give him a round of applause.

1039
01:21:32,083 --> 01:21:36,541
Thank you. Thank you so much.

1040
01:21:37,541 --> 01:21:41,125
This celebration
will close with a major award.

1041
01:21:41,208 --> 01:21:44,000
An award that fills us with pride,
that for the first time

1042
01:21:44,083 --> 01:21:47,500
will be given to a Mexican

1043
01:21:47,583 --> 01:21:51,583
or Latin American journalist.

1044
01:21:51,666 --> 01:21:54,166
- Where's the guest of honor?
- Silverio!

1045
01:21:54,250 --> 01:21:57,916
Come up and say a few words.

1046
01:21:58,708 --> 01:22:01,184
- Dad, where are you going?
- Where is he?

1047
01:22:01,208 --> 01:22:04,958
- Silverio!
- He'll be here soon.

1048
01:22:05,458 --> 01:22:09,125
- Silverio! Silverio! Silverio!
- It seems he's missing.

1049
01:22:09,208 --> 01:22:12,250
- Silverio! Silverio!
- Let's all shout his name!

1050
01:22:12,333 --> 01:22:13,791
Silverio! Silverio!

1051
01:22:13,875 --> 01:22:17,500
I've said my piece.
Now it's Silverio's turn.

1052
01:22:18,916 --> 01:22:23,875
Silverio! Silverio! Silverio!

1053
01:22:23,958 --> 01:22:25,333
MEN'S RESTROOM

1054
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:14,666
What is this?

1055
01:23:16,125 --> 01:23:17,916
Impossible.

1056
01:23:19,583 --> 01:23:22,875
My little boy has turned so gray.

1057
01:23:23,458 --> 01:23:25,166
I'm nearly your age, Pa.

1058
01:23:25,250 --> 01:23:27,916
You're an old man now.

1059
01:23:28,750 --> 01:23:31,208
Age comes without warning.

1060
01:23:31,750 --> 01:23:34,791
Then it turns into a full-time job.

1061
01:23:35,583 --> 01:23:39,666
Walking, eating, using the bathroom...
everything's a problem.

1062
01:23:40,583 --> 01:23:41,875
No one ever told me.

1063
01:23:42,458 --> 01:23:45,083
Nobody ever warns you about it.

1064
01:23:45,791 --> 01:23:47,500
I'm glad you came.

1065
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:51,708
How could I miss my boy's party?

1066
01:23:52,791 --> 01:23:55,458
I'm sorry your mother couldn't be here.

1067
01:23:55,958 --> 01:24:01,000
The thought that I'll never be
with her again is unbearable.

1068
01:24:01,500 --> 01:24:04,791
But sometimes I visit her
in her room and pull her by the legs.

1069
01:24:15,333 --> 01:24:16,333
Son...

1070
01:24:17,041 --> 01:24:20,375
I'm so sorry I never told you

1071
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:23,083
how proud I am of you.

1072
01:24:23,916 --> 01:24:26,041
You did, though, Pa.

1073
01:24:26,625 --> 01:24:29,125
In your way. Without saying it.

1074
01:24:30,208 --> 01:24:32,000
I realized that eventually.

1075
01:24:33,208 --> 01:24:34,583
You were a great father.

1076
01:24:35,166 --> 01:24:38,458
I lost all I had.

1077
01:24:39,083 --> 01:24:41,666
That's why I couldn't be more.

1078
01:24:42,250 --> 01:24:44,583
A father and sometimes a husband.

1079
01:24:45,625 --> 01:24:47,791
But I was always ashamed

1080
01:24:47,875 --> 01:24:51,083
of what I could have been but wasn't.

1081
01:24:52,333 --> 01:24:55,458
But you, you're a man of the world.

1082
01:24:55,541 --> 01:24:57,750
- Yeah.
- You're very successful.

1083
01:24:57,833 --> 01:24:58,875
Mm-hmm.

1084
01:24:59,375 --> 01:25:01,125
And you were such a loser.

1085
01:25:03,125 --> 01:25:05,916
I promise, your mother
and I never saw this coming.

1086
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:08,458
I know.

1087
01:25:08,958 --> 01:25:10,458
Me neither.

1088
01:25:12,375 --> 01:25:16,000
You know, sometimes
I'm also ashamed of what I am

1089
01:25:16,083 --> 01:25:17,916
and what I should have been.

1090
01:25:22,125 --> 01:25:23,333
Are you okay?

1091
01:25:24,291 --> 01:25:28,125
It sure would have helped me
to know how you felt about me back then.

1092
01:25:28,750 --> 01:25:30,208
To hear it.

1093
01:25:31,958 --> 01:25:34,208
To know you saw me.

1094
01:25:36,416 --> 01:25:38,166
I did the best I could.

1095
01:25:39,083 --> 01:25:41,500
We always do our best,

1096
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:43,708
but it's never enough.

1097
01:25:43,791 --> 01:25:45,333
Mm-hmm.

1098
01:25:45,416 --> 01:25:48,458
Success has been my biggest failure.

1099
01:25:49,583 --> 01:25:54,416
I'd trade everything to give Camila
and Lorenzo what you gave us.

1100
01:25:54,500 --> 01:25:56,541
Come on. Chin up.

1101
01:25:56,625 --> 01:25:58,416
This is a party.

1102
01:25:58,916 --> 01:26:03,791
Depression's a bourgeois illness,
fruit of too much leisure.

1103
01:26:04,291 --> 01:26:07,791
We've got no time for sorrow. Hmm?

1104
01:26:13,625 --> 01:26:14,875
I see you every day.

1105
01:26:15,375 --> 01:26:18,125
I feel you close to me
because I let you go.

1106
01:26:19,125 --> 01:26:22,625
I miss your big hands, your clean scent.

1107
01:26:23,250 --> 01:26:25,375
I miss our talks.

1108
01:26:25,458 --> 01:26:27,500
You always brought out the best in me.

1109
01:26:27,583 --> 01:26:32,625
I'm always here, son,
whenever you need me.

1110
01:26:36,500 --> 01:26:38,833
I still can't let Mateo go.

1111
01:26:40,083 --> 01:26:42,208
You'll eventually learn how.

1112
01:26:42,833 --> 01:26:46,750
Life is just a brief series
of senseless events.

1113
01:26:46,833 --> 01:26:48,666
You must surrender to it.

1114
01:26:49,166 --> 01:26:51,291
Clench your fists.

1115
01:26:51,375 --> 01:26:53,041
Hold your head high.

1116
01:26:53,541 --> 01:26:58,750
Let's drown our shame with a drink
and toast to your success.

1117
01:27:12,916 --> 01:27:14,583
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

1118
01:27:30,708 --> 01:27:32,625
Remember what I always told you?

1119
01:27:34,125 --> 01:27:37,375
Take a swig of success.

1120
01:27:37,458 --> 01:27:40,500
Swish it around, and spit it out.

1121
01:27:40,583 --> 01:27:43,958
Otherwise, it'll poison you.

1122
01:28:35,166 --> 01:28:36,625
<i>Who's there?</i>

1123
01:28:37,583 --> 01:28:38,916
<i>Hi, Ma.</i>

1124
01:28:40,458 --> 01:28:42,375
<i>What a surprise.</i>

1125
01:28:44,083 --> 01:28:46,083
<i>I didn't know you were coming.</i>

1126
01:28:46,166 --> 01:28:48,767
<i>Yes, I called you yesterday.
We talked for a good while.</i>

1127
01:28:48,791 --> 01:28:50,416
<i>I said I'd be here today.</i>

1128
01:28:52,333 --> 01:28:54,833
<i>Did you talk
to your brother and sisters?</i>

1129
01:28:54,916 --> 01:28:56,583
<i>I saw them at the party.</i>

1130
01:28:56,666 --> 01:28:58,291
<i>The party?</i>

1131
01:28:58,375 --> 01:29:02,291
<i>The Mexican journalists
held a tribute for me.</i>

1132
01:29:02,375 --> 01:29:04,916
<i>I was going to invite you, but I thought...</i>

1133
01:29:06,625 --> 01:29:09,958
<i>I thought
you'd come with the kids.</i>

1134
01:29:11,791 --> 01:29:14,583
<i>How are Camila and Mateo?</i>

1135
01:29:14,666 --> 01:29:15,666
Lorenzo.

1136
01:29:15,708 --> 01:29:16,958
Camila and Lorenzo.

1137
01:29:17,458 --> 01:29:19,250
Ah. What did I say?

1138
01:29:19,333 --> 01:29:20,333
Mateo.

1139
01:29:20,875 --> 01:29:22,559
Impossible.

1140
01:29:22,583 --> 01:29:24,291
Your Mateo was born dead.

1141
01:29:24,375 --> 01:29:26,375
He wasn't born dead, Mama.

1142
01:29:26,458 --> 01:29:29,583
He lived for a day, 30 hours.

1143
01:29:30,083 --> 01:29:32,000
That's not living.

1144
01:29:32,583 --> 01:29:35,250
Just like this isn't living.

1145
01:29:37,583 --> 01:29:39,208
I should be dead.

1146
01:29:39,291 --> 01:29:42,250
Mama, you've been saying that
for ten years.

1147
01:29:42,333 --> 01:29:44,875
Everyone's croaked, and you're still here.

1148
01:29:46,125 --> 01:29:47,375
What'd you do yesterday?

1149
01:29:47,458 --> 01:29:49,083
We went to the movies.

1150
01:29:49,166 --> 01:29:51,916
With Aunt Elvira
and her friends from the nursing home?

1151
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:53,833
Yeah. Mm-hmm.

1152
01:29:53,916 --> 01:29:54,916
And?

1153
01:29:56,458 --> 01:29:57,958
A bunch of old people.

1154
01:29:59,375 --> 01:30:00,500
Really boring.

1155
01:30:00,583 --> 01:30:02,833
What did you expect?

1156
01:30:04,458 --> 01:30:06,208
People like me.

1157
01:30:06,916 --> 01:30:10,708
My age.

1158
01:30:10,791 --> 01:30:12,875
Something weird happened.

1159
01:30:12,958 --> 01:30:14,041
What?

1160
01:30:15,166 --> 01:30:18,708
- I went to the bathroom in the cinema...
- Oh?

1161
01:30:19,458 --> 01:30:20,708
You won't believe it.

1162
01:30:21,375 --> 01:30:23,291
My bed was in there.

1163
01:30:23,375 --> 01:30:27,625
Someone had put my whole bedroom in there.

1164
01:30:27,708 --> 01:30:31,416
- You must have dreamed that.
- No, son.

1165
01:30:31,500 --> 01:30:35,333
Someone took my home to the cinema.

1166
01:30:36,166 --> 01:30:39,541
There it is... outside.

1167
01:30:40,875 --> 01:30:44,125
All I wanted was to see
the end of the movie.

1168
01:30:44,208 --> 01:30:45,708
We're at your home, Ma.

1169
01:30:46,333 --> 01:30:49,666
Come on, let's look at the patio.

1170
01:30:52,500 --> 01:30:54,500
See how the shrub blossomed?

1171
01:30:54,583 --> 01:30:55,625
- Huh?
- Yeah.

1172
01:30:55,708 --> 01:30:58,375
This is your patio.
This is your house.

1173
01:30:58,458 --> 01:31:01,250
Mm-hmm.

1174
01:31:01,333 --> 01:31:03,250
How are things with Susana?

1175
01:31:04,541 --> 01:31:07,458
Oh, son.

1176
01:31:07,541 --> 01:31:09,083
This maid is robbing me.

1177
01:31:09,166 --> 01:31:11,875
She's not a maid. She's your nurse.

1178
01:31:11,958 --> 01:31:15,625
Yeah. These people are all the same.

1179
01:31:15,708 --> 01:31:19,958
Susana's educated. She's a professional.
Why do you look down on her?

1180
01:31:20,041 --> 01:31:24,250
A few days ago, your papa
brought me some bracelets

1181
01:31:24,333 --> 01:31:26,416
that belonged to your grandmother.

1182
01:31:26,500 --> 01:31:28,125
And now I can't find them.

1183
01:31:28,208 --> 01:31:29,916
Papa died eight years ago.

1184
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:32,583
No, he didn't.

1185
01:31:32,666 --> 01:31:34,041
He died, Mama.

1186
01:31:37,041 --> 01:31:39,375
What are you saying?

1187
01:31:40,625 --> 01:31:44,833
I saw your father
at Christmas at your brother's house.

1188
01:31:44,916 --> 01:31:47,083
He wouldn't talk to me.

1189
01:31:47,166 --> 01:31:50,458
He must have been angry,
or he's with some other woman.

1190
01:31:52,666 --> 01:31:54,750
He comes to see me now and then.

1191
01:31:54,833 --> 01:31:57,666
When I'm sleeping on my stomach,
he grabs me by the legs.

1192
01:31:57,750 --> 01:32:01,333
Then he lulls me with his song.

1193
01:32:01,416 --> 01:32:02,416
What song?

1194
01:32:09,875 --> 01:32:11,916
- Oh, I don't remember.
- Mm.

1195
01:32:12,833 --> 01:32:15,583
It's that...

1196
01:32:15,666 --> 01:32:21,625
...the first time I made love
with your dad, we listened to that song.

1197
01:32:22,750 --> 01:32:29,208
And then... he'd whistle it to you
when you were in my belly.

1198
01:32:30,083 --> 01:32:36,208
And when you were little,
and you'd scream and throw tantrums,

1199
01:32:36,291 --> 01:32:40,875
he'd whistle that song to you,
and you'd calm down.

1200
01:32:40,958 --> 01:32:43,000
Really? I don't remember.

1201
01:32:43,583 --> 01:32:45,958
I don't remember anything
from my childhood.

1202
01:32:46,041 --> 01:32:47,458
Who sang it?

1203
01:32:47,541 --> 01:32:53,583
It was by Agustín Lara or... Pérez Prado.

1204
01:32:53,666 --> 01:32:54,958
Doesn't ring a bell.

1205
01:32:55,916 --> 01:33:02,000
Talk with your mouth, son.
You're driving me crazy.

1206
01:33:02,083 --> 01:33:03,333
Sorry.

1207
01:33:03,416 --> 01:33:06,583
But try and remember the song, Mama.

1208
01:33:07,208 --> 01:33:09,208
Who sang it?

1209
01:33:09,291 --> 01:33:12,416
The selfish man took it with him.

1210
01:35:02,625 --> 01:35:03,791
Excuse me.

1211
01:36:36,583 --> 01:36:38,500
Good afternoon, sir.
What'll you have?

1212
01:36:38,583 --> 01:36:40,125
We've got tripe, <i>campechano</i>...

1213
01:36:40,208 --> 01:36:43,625
Give me two beef tongue, please.

1214
01:36:44,125 --> 01:36:45,583
Coming right up.

1215
01:36:46,375 --> 01:36:48,166
- With everything?
- Yeah, everything.

1216
01:37:02,875 --> 01:37:04,666
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

1217
01:37:06,208 --> 01:37:08,000
- Do you need help?
- No.

1218
01:37:09,375 --> 01:37:11,041
- Let me...
- Don't touch me!

1219
01:37:11,666 --> 01:37:12,916
What's up with her?

1220
01:37:13,416 --> 01:37:15,256
- I don't know.
- Is she dead?

1221
01:37:15,791 --> 01:37:17,000
I'm not dead.

1222
01:37:17,541 --> 01:37:18,583
I'm missing.

1223
01:37:19,750 --> 01:37:23,250
- But you are right here, miss.
- Leave her. They do this.

1224
01:37:23,333 --> 01:37:25,708
They go missing,
yet they keep pestering everyone.

1225
01:37:25,791 --> 01:37:27,458
They neither return nor die.

1226
01:37:29,791 --> 01:37:32,458
Miss, what's going on? Tell me.

1227
01:37:32,541 --> 01:37:33,666
I can't.

1228
01:37:34,166 --> 01:37:36,041
They stay by not staying.

1229
01:37:36,125 --> 01:37:39,166
All they do is complain, buddy.

1230
01:37:43,666 --> 01:37:45,458
Please, tell me what's wrong.

1231
01:37:46,083 --> 01:37:49,416
Trust me, it's best not to know.

1232
01:40:39,291 --> 01:40:40,916
Martín!

1233
01:40:48,250 --> 01:40:49,250
Hey!

1234
01:40:50,416 --> 01:40:51,458
Hey!

1235
01:40:52,375 --> 01:40:54,541
Police!

1236
01:44:35,291 --> 01:44:38,333
Ideas ate the deities!

1237
01:44:48,458 --> 01:44:50,916
The deities became ideas!

1238
01:45:03,083 --> 01:45:05,375
Great bladders full of bile!

1239
01:45:14,375 --> 01:45:16,750
The bladders burst!

1240
01:45:27,583 --> 01:45:29,666
The idols exploded!

1241
01:45:36,375 --> 01:45:38,416
Putrefaction of deities!

1242
01:45:46,583 --> 01:45:49,000
Swarm of flies!

1243
01:45:54,041 --> 01:45:56,625
The sanctuary was a dung heap!

1244
01:45:58,833 --> 01:46:01,208
The dung heap a nursery!

1245
01:46:03,791 --> 01:46:06,958
Armed ideas sprouted,
idealized ideodeities,

1246
01:46:07,041 --> 01:46:08,708
sharpened syllogisms!

1247
01:46:10,208 --> 01:46:12,125
Cannibal deities!

1248
01:46:15,125 --> 01:46:17,291
Ideas idiotic as deities.

1249
01:46:19,166 --> 01:46:22,750
Rabid dogs.
Dogs in love with their own vomit.

1250
01:46:29,625 --> 01:46:31,500
We have dug up rage.

1251
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:35,833
The amphitheater of the genital sun
is a dung heap.

1252
01:46:36,333 --> 01:46:38,916
A dead country where none of us die.

1253
01:46:40,625 --> 01:46:45,166
Who do you think you are,
stealing Octavio Paz's ideas?

1254
01:46:45,250 --> 01:46:48,000
His words exist
because I existed, Silverio.

1255
01:46:48,083 --> 01:46:50,458
Don't make me laugh,
Hernán Cortés.

1256
01:46:50,541 --> 01:46:52,250
You were just a thug,

1257
01:46:52,333 --> 01:46:55,666
a jackal with a machete,
slicing blindly through the jungle.

1258
01:46:55,750 --> 01:46:59,083
- There's not a single book in your body.
- You don't know me.

1259
01:46:59,166 --> 01:47:01,041
- No one knows me.
- Eh.

1260
01:47:02,125 --> 01:47:05,875
If your sense of shame was proportional
to the disaster your conquest wrought,

1261
01:47:05,958 --> 01:47:07,500
maybe you'd be a bit humbler.

1262
01:47:07,583 --> 01:47:09,583
Nah.

1263
01:47:10,333 --> 01:47:11,375
Got a light?

1264
01:47:25,500 --> 01:47:27,208
I know what you're thinking.

1265
01:47:27,291 --> 01:47:31,083
Five hundred years people have blamed me
without understanding shit.

1266
01:47:31,166 --> 01:47:34,666
- Don't you realize where you're sitting?
- Don't you? Look around.

1267
01:47:34,750 --> 01:47:37,375
The most beautiful city,
inhabited by 300,000 Indians.

1268
01:47:37,458 --> 01:47:39,208
- They weren't Indians.
- Americans, then.

1269
01:47:39,291 --> 01:47:40,458
- Still wrong.
- Whatever.

1270
01:47:40,541 --> 01:47:45,750
How could 400 Spaniards with 16 horsemen
and a little gunpowder trample an empire?

1271
01:47:45,833 --> 01:47:47,916
- Those Indians...
- They weren't Indians!

1272
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:51,083
Cannibals, whatever.
They ate each other like savages.

1273
01:47:51,166 --> 01:47:53,000
They all hated each other.

1274
01:47:53,083 --> 01:47:55,750
And they all hated the <i>tlatoani</i>.

1275
01:47:56,875 --> 01:47:59,708
In that corner right there,
I met Moctezuma.

1276
01:48:00,416 --> 01:48:01,416
- Good dude.
- No.

1277
01:48:01,500 --> 01:48:02,416
Yeah.

1278
01:48:02,500 --> 01:48:07,750
That corner right there
is where we discovered Europe.

1279
01:48:07,833 --> 01:48:10,208
We were just trying to help you.

1280
01:48:10,291 --> 01:48:12,083
We gave you our God and our language.

1281
01:48:12,166 --> 01:48:15,625
And smallpox and measles
and the fear of hell.

1282
01:48:15,708 --> 01:48:18,125
And gonorrhea.

1283
01:48:18,208 --> 01:48:21,416
And your army
and the oligarchy and your church

1284
01:48:21,500 --> 01:48:25,583
and 300 years of
the ugliest fucking viceroys imaginable!

1285
01:48:25,666 --> 01:48:28,541
Look at our god Centéotl.

1286
01:48:29,041 --> 01:48:32,833
You buried our gods
and brought us a new one, still bloody,

1287
01:48:32,916 --> 01:48:34,833
tortured, and crucified.

1288
01:48:34,916 --> 01:48:36,958
Don't be a moron, Cortés.

1289
01:48:37,041 --> 01:48:39,208
You were nothing more
than a useful foreigner.

1290
01:48:39,291 --> 01:48:43,833
It's easy to win a war when the enemy,
our people, betrays and attacks itself.

1291
01:48:43,916 --> 01:48:46,291
I never wanted war.

1292
01:48:46,375 --> 01:48:48,791
I fell in love with this land
and its people.

1293
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:52,458
Pretty words from the mouth of a murderer.

1294
01:48:52,541 --> 01:48:53,916
Murderer?

1295
01:48:54,708 --> 01:48:57,250
I laid the foundations for a new world.

1296
01:48:57,333 --> 01:49:00,916
My children were the first Mexicans,
so I am your father, like it or not.

1297
01:49:01,000 --> 01:49:03,916
I lived a Mexican,
and I died more Mexican than anyone.

1298
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:07,791
I'm sorry to say, people hate you
as much in Mexico as they do in Spain.

1299
01:49:07,875 --> 01:49:09,875
There's not a single statue of you.

1300
01:49:11,291 --> 01:49:14,375
Sometimes we think
we're from several places,

1301
01:49:14,458 --> 01:49:17,041
when in fact, we're from nowhere.

1302
01:49:18,583 --> 01:49:21,000
Maybe hatred is every great man's fate.

1303
01:49:22,416 --> 01:49:24,625
And quit with
the childish tantrums, Silverio.

1304
01:49:24,708 --> 01:49:26,041
Why are you so mad?

1305
01:49:26,125 --> 01:49:28,333
It's not like you're an Indian,
mulatto, mongrel.

1306
01:49:28,416 --> 01:49:32,666
Look at yourself, you're more Creole
and Mestizo than my own children.

1307
01:49:32,750 --> 01:49:36,291
You don't want to be Indians.
Or Spaniards.

1308
01:49:37,375 --> 01:49:40,791
You've willfully condemned
yourselves to bastardy,

1309
01:49:40,875 --> 01:49:42,833
to coexist in limbo.

1310
01:49:42,916 --> 01:49:44,875
For fuck's sake.

1311
01:49:44,958 --> 01:49:47,083
Turn that shit off! You're gonna blind me!

1312
01:49:47,166 --> 01:49:48,375
What is it?

1313
01:49:48,458 --> 01:49:51,083
- He burned me with that cigarette!
- Don't move.

1314
01:49:51,166 --> 01:49:53,250
Don't move. Don't move.

1315
01:49:53,333 --> 01:49:56,750
Stop moving! Stay still!
We're doing another take!

1316
01:49:56,833 --> 01:49:59,291
Cut! Martín!

1317
01:49:59,375 --> 01:50:01,625
Martín, don't let anyone move
for Christ's sake!

1318
01:50:01,708 --> 01:50:02,958
What's up, <i>cabrón</i>?

1319
01:50:03,041 --> 01:50:04,750
<i>- Five minutes!</i>
- Wait!

1320
01:50:04,833 --> 01:50:06,833
<i>Dead and missing people
to your positions!</i>

1321
01:50:06,875 --> 01:50:09,666
Martín, we're doing
another take. Everyone, stay still!

1322
01:50:09,750 --> 01:50:10,750
Goddammit!

1323
01:50:11,333 --> 01:50:17,083
I'm good. Nah,
I'm here shooting with a cocky director.

1324
01:50:17,166 --> 01:50:22,500
One of those movies about
Hernán Cortés or some bullshit.

1325
01:50:22,583 --> 01:50:25,083
<i>Sube, Pelayo, sube!</i>

1326
01:50:25,166 --> 01:50:26,708
<i>Sube, Pelayo, sube!</i>

1327
01:50:26,791 --> 01:50:28,083
<i>Sube, Pelayo, sube!</i>

1328
01:50:28,166 --> 01:50:30,083
<i>Sube, Pelayo, sube!</i>

1329
01:50:30,166 --> 01:50:31,791

1330
01:50:31,875 --> 01:50:33,708

1336
01:50:41,875 --> 01:50:43,458

01:50:48,458 --> 01:50:50,166

01:50:50,250 --> 01:50:51,875

1344
01:50:55,208 --> 01:50:57,416
<i>Sube, Pelayo, sube!</i>

1345
01:51:26,958 --> 01:51:29,500
Nice fucking house, man.

1346
01:51:29,583 --> 01:51:32,125
Did Pablo Galindo ask you for rent?

1347
01:51:32,208 --> 01:51:34,250
He just lent it to me
for a couple of days.

1348
01:51:34,333 --> 01:51:37,625
Rich people don't do anything for free.

1349
01:51:37,708 --> 01:51:39,500
That's why they're rich.

1350
01:51:39,583 --> 01:51:41,666
This is gorgeous.

1351
01:51:41,750 --> 01:51:43,958
He will charge for this
one way or another.

1352
01:51:44,041 --> 01:51:47,125
Hortensia and I are going
to the club to get our beach stuff.

1353
01:51:47,208 --> 01:51:51,541
- On my way. Get Lorenzo.
- Lorenzo is taking a nap.

1354
01:51:51,625 --> 01:51:54,666
No. There'll be time to nap later.

1355
01:51:54,750 --> 01:51:57,333
Life's rich with rich friends, brother.

1356
01:51:57,833 --> 01:52:01,041
I'm going to the beach
before you start breaking my balls.

1357
01:52:01,125 --> 01:52:04,416
Just don't steal the flatware, <i>cabrones</i>!

1358
01:52:04,500 --> 01:52:08,875
- Only the real silver!
- Or some nice wine!

1359
01:52:33,375 --> 01:52:34,625
Good morning, sir.

1360
01:52:34,708 --> 01:52:35,708
Go on ahead.

1361
01:52:41,958 --> 01:52:43,250
Pa!

1362
01:52:44,458 --> 01:52:45,708
Come here!

1363
01:52:53,458 --> 01:52:55,916
- What's up?
- This man won't let Hortensia in.

1364
01:52:56,000 --> 01:52:57,625
Why? Is there a problem?

1365
01:52:57,708 --> 01:52:59,791
- Servants can't enter.
- She's family.

1366
01:52:59,875 --> 01:53:01,208
Rules of the place.

1367
01:53:01,291 --> 01:53:03,583
Can't you make an exception?

1368
01:53:03,666 --> 01:53:07,000
We're guests of Pablo Galindo.
We're staying at his home...

1369
01:53:07,083 --> 01:53:10,791
Sorry, sir.
But all the owners agreed to the rule.

1370
01:53:10,875 --> 01:53:13,125
Servants can't use the facilities.

1371
01:53:13,208 --> 01:53:15,166
Not even to walk the beach?

1372
01:53:15,666 --> 01:53:16,833
I'm sorry, miss.

1373
01:53:17,333 --> 01:53:18,875
Who's your superior?

1374
01:53:18,958 --> 01:53:19,958
He's off today.

1375
01:53:22,291 --> 01:53:25,458
- Hortensia, go home...
- No! If Hortensia can't go, no one will.

1376
01:53:25,541 --> 01:53:29,208
- Those are the rules of the place.
- You have to do something. At least...

1377
01:53:29,291 --> 01:53:31,083
Those are the rules of the place!

1378
01:53:31,166 --> 01:53:33,916
- I'll call Pablo, and...
- Why bother, sir?

1379
01:53:34,958 --> 01:53:37,916
It's those rich people who make the rules.

1380
01:53:38,000 --> 01:53:39,416
Let's get out of here.

1381
01:53:39,916 --> 01:53:42,333
Stick your beach up your ass, then!

1382
01:54:05,083 --> 01:54:06,916
- It's official.
- What?

1383
01:54:07,000 --> 01:54:09,625
Amazon just bought Baja California.

1384
01:54:09,708 --> 01:54:13,458
- This beach now belongs to the gringos.
- Amazing!

1385
01:54:14,458 --> 01:54:18,958
Let them buy all of Mexico.
We will be better off.

1386
01:54:19,041 --> 01:54:22,583
I had no idea that people
in my own family were so unpatriotic.

1387
01:54:22,666 --> 01:54:25,250
Imagine what it would be like...

1388
01:54:46,916 --> 01:54:48,291
What?

1389
01:54:48,375 --> 01:54:50,208
You seem famished.

1390
01:54:51,250 --> 01:54:53,208
The fruit tastes like fruit here.

1391
01:54:53,708 --> 01:54:55,000
How are you?

1392
01:54:55,083 --> 01:54:56,166
Fine.

1393
01:54:56,250 --> 01:54:59,166
Mom wants to go to the beach.
She says it's a way off.

1394
01:54:59,250 --> 01:55:02,125
- She wants to get there before sundown.
- We'll leave soon.

1395
01:55:02,208 --> 01:55:04,291
But tell me, how are things?

1396
01:55:05,000 --> 01:55:07,375
- What things?
- How's everything in Boston?

1397
01:55:07,458 --> 01:55:09,708
- You still with Mark?
- Yeah.

1398
01:55:09,791 --> 01:55:13,166
Hmm? You don't sound convinced.

1399
01:55:13,250 --> 01:55:16,541
- It's not that.
- Hmm.

1400
01:55:16,625 --> 01:55:18,500
- Everything's fine with Mark.
- Ah.

1401
01:55:18,583 --> 01:55:21,625
Not everything. I mean, it never is, but...

1402
01:55:22,625 --> 01:55:25,000
I hadn't thought about Mark
until you said his name.

1403
01:55:25,791 --> 01:55:27,458
Well then?

1404
01:55:31,250 --> 01:55:32,416
I don't know.

1405
01:55:33,500 --> 01:55:34,833
It's weird being here.

1406
01:55:35,333 --> 01:55:37,458
Where? On the beach?

1407
01:55:40,083 --> 01:55:41,333
In Mexico.

1408
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:43,875
I don't get it.

1409
01:55:43,958 --> 01:55:44,958
You do.

1410
01:55:45,041 --> 01:55:48,833
Why? Your cousins are here,
your aunts and uncles...

1411
01:55:48,916 --> 01:55:50,958
- Exactly.
- Exactly what?

1412
01:55:54,625 --> 01:55:58,583
It's everything that never was.
And seeing them reminds me of that.

1413
01:56:01,500 --> 01:56:03,083
Everything that wasn't.

1414
01:56:03,166 --> 01:56:05,583
Yeah. Including Mateo.

1415
01:56:06,916 --> 01:56:11,375
Mateo's not the only one in Bardo, Pa.
Sometimes I feel like we're all with him.

1416
01:56:11,458 --> 01:56:16,291
Camila, your family will always be here.
Your home's here, your grandparents...

1417
01:56:16,375 --> 01:56:18,791
Dad, stop, I am fine. I am just sad!

1418
01:56:19,291 --> 01:56:22,291
And that's okay.
Feeling sad is good for you sometimes.

1419
01:56:22,375 --> 01:56:25,041
But you always want to fix things,
explain them away.

1420
01:56:25,125 --> 01:56:27,875
Some things just are what they are.

1421
01:56:43,166 --> 01:56:45,708
My lease is up next month.

1422
01:56:46,250 --> 01:56:47,166
Mm?

1423
01:56:47,250 --> 01:56:50,500
- I was thinking of coming back to Mexico.
- Why?

1424
01:56:51,333 --> 01:56:54,666
- To live here.
- What about your job in Boston?

1425
01:56:56,375 --> 01:56:59,041
The job's fine,
but I can't grow there anymore.

1426
01:56:59,125 --> 01:57:03,666
I am tired of eating a salad
on a plastic tray alone at my desk.

1427
01:57:03,750 --> 01:57:05,541
What will you do in Mexico?

1428
01:57:06,041 --> 01:57:07,083
I don't know.

1429
01:57:08,541 --> 01:57:09,625
I like the idea,

1430
01:57:09,708 --> 01:57:12,041
but you'll have
to get used to being way more careful.

1431
01:57:12,125 --> 01:57:15,708
My friends live here,
and nothing's ever happened to them.

1432
01:57:15,791 --> 01:57:18,791
Because they live
in a gated community

1433
01:57:18,875 --> 01:57:20,333
with guards all around,

1434
01:57:20,416 --> 01:57:22,125
and drivers take them everywhere.

1435
01:57:22,208 --> 01:57:24,291
Are you up for that? I'm not.

1436
01:57:24,375 --> 01:57:27,750
At least they don't live
in a pasteurized reality like us.

1437
01:57:28,250 --> 01:57:34,958
A pasteurized reality where you can walk
around at night or take public transit.

1438
01:57:35,458 --> 01:57:37,583
You've never used public transportation.

1439
01:57:37,666 --> 01:57:39,875
- I use it.
- Come on.

1440
01:57:39,958 --> 01:57:43,000
Where's the Santa Monica train stop?

1441
01:57:43,083 --> 01:57:45,291
Between Ocean and Venice.

1442
01:57:45,375 --> 01:57:46,455
Wrong.

1443
01:57:46,500 --> 01:57:48,666
How much is a ticket?

1444
01:57:48,750 --> 01:57:51,541
- I don't know.
- Of course you don't.

1445
01:57:53,833 --> 01:57:55,583
We're grown-ups, Pa.

1446
01:57:56,291 --> 01:57:58,875
We're free to choose where to live.

1447
01:57:59,375 --> 01:58:00,416
Okay?

1448
01:58:00,916 --> 01:58:04,333
Camila, you know I'm here for anything.

1449
01:58:04,833 --> 01:58:07,500
But you can't ask me
not to want the best for you.

1450
01:58:07,583 --> 01:58:10,250
Get a move on. It's getting late.

1451
01:58:11,500 --> 01:58:17,125
Sometimes what's best for you
isn't what's best for us.

1452
01:58:18,041 --> 01:58:20,583
Let's go before Mama chews us out.

1453
02:02:38,500 --> 02:02:39,666
How's that going?

1454
02:02:40,166 --> 02:02:43,125
It's going.

1455
02:02:45,041 --> 02:02:49,500
Hey, tell me if you want to invite
Jon and Stephen.

1456
02:02:50,583 --> 02:02:51,458
Pa...

1457
02:02:51,541 --> 02:02:53,250
- Hmm?
- Remember Paco?

1458
02:02:53,333 --> 02:02:54,416
Who?

1459
02:02:54,500 --> 02:02:56,333
Paco, Guido, and Ernesto.

1460
02:02:56,833 --> 02:03:00,166
- My axolotls. When we lived in Mexico.
- Yeah, sure.

1461
02:03:00,250 --> 02:03:05,458
Well, when I was a kid
and we moved to LA, I brought them with us

1462
02:03:06,000 --> 02:03:08,291
'cause I left all my friends in Mexico.

1463
02:03:08,375 --> 02:03:12,208
So I decided to hide Paco,
Guido, and Ernesto in a suitcase

1464
02:03:12,291 --> 02:03:14,416
with a plastic bag and water.

1465
02:03:14,916 --> 02:03:16,166
I didn't tell anyone.

1466
02:03:16,250 --> 02:03:17,958
And when we arrived to the new house,

1467
02:03:18,041 --> 02:03:20,416
the first thing I did
was open the suitcase.

1468
02:03:20,500 --> 02:03:23,833
It was soaking wet,
and the plastic bag was open,

1469
02:03:23,916 --> 02:03:26,833
and my friends were lost in the clothes.

1470
02:03:27,333 --> 02:03:30,833
And they didn't move,
so I decided to throw them in the toilet

1471
02:03:30,916 --> 02:03:32,708
to see if they could swim.

1472
02:03:32,791 --> 02:03:35,208
And they sank.

1473
02:03:35,291 --> 02:03:39,958
So I realized they were dead,
and I hid 'em in a shoebox under my bed.

1474
02:03:40,458 --> 02:03:44,291
After a few days, it started to smell,
so I put 'em in the freezer.

1475
02:03:44,375 --> 02:03:48,458
And, yeah, I remember Mom was cooking
some fish for dinner,

1476
02:03:48,541 --> 02:03:52,833
and I didn't even want to touch my food
'cause I was freaking out,

1477
02:03:52,916 --> 02:03:55,250
convinced that we were eating my friends.

1478
02:04:17,041 --> 02:04:18,291
What is it?

1479
02:04:19,000 --> 02:04:21,916
I never knew any of that.
Why didn't you tell me?

1480
02:04:23,250 --> 02:04:24,375
I think you were gone.

1481
02:04:25,750 --> 02:04:28,416
You were in Morocco doing something.

1482
02:04:30,416 --> 02:04:31,625
Or maybe you were home.

1483
02:04:31,708 --> 02:04:33,166
I don't know.

1484
02:04:33,791 --> 02:04:35,041
Doesn't matter.

1485
02:04:52,083 --> 02:04:55,208
<i>If you find a bomb
lying around the airport premises,</i>

1486
02:04:55,291 --> 02:04:58,333
<i>please bring it
to the nearest information booth.</i>

1487
02:04:58,416 --> 02:05:00,791
<i>Thank you for your consideration.</i>

1488
02:05:02,333 --> 02:05:06,208
<i>Please refrain from turning left.</i>

1489
02:05:10,916 --> 02:05:12,208
Hello, sir.

1490
02:05:12,291 --> 02:05:14,250
Please remove your glasses, sir.

1491
02:05:16,833 --> 02:05:19,750
- What is the purpose of your trip?
- We live here.

1492
02:05:21,583 --> 02:05:23,250
No, you don't live here.

1493
02:05:23,333 --> 02:05:24,333
Fingerprints.

1494
02:05:24,375 --> 02:05:26,458
Oh, yes. We do live here.

1495
02:05:26,541 --> 02:05:28,750
I'm a journalist, and this is my home.

1496
02:05:29,416 --> 02:05:31,083
This is not your home, sir.

1497
02:05:31,583 --> 02:05:34,541
You have an O-1 visa.
Please look at the camera.

1498
02:05:34,625 --> 02:05:38,208
Yeah, I have an O-1 visa
because I work here and I pay taxes here.

1499
02:05:38,291 --> 02:05:41,916
- So I think I can call this place my home.
- Fingerprints.

1500
02:05:42,500 --> 02:05:44,916
No, sir,
you cannot call this place your home.

1501
02:05:46,333 --> 02:05:50,333
If you look me in the face,
you might recognize me...

1502
02:05:50,416 --> 02:05:52,434
- We speak English.
- Dad.

1503
02:05:52,458 --> 02:05:53,658
What's your name?

1504
02:05:53,708 --> 02:05:55,125
- Excuse me?
- Your name.

1505
02:05:55,208 --> 02:05:56,125
Drop it.

1506
02:05:56,208 --> 02:05:59,833
- Remove your arm, sir.
- I want to talk to your supervisor.

1507
02:06:01,166 --> 02:06:03,375
That will not be necessary.

1508
02:06:03,458 --> 02:06:05,750
Oh,
"That will not be necessary."

1509
02:06:12,541 --> 02:06:13,750
You can go now.

1510
02:06:13,833 --> 02:06:14,833
Next.

1511
02:06:15,250 --> 02:06:16,333
Asshole. Come on.

1512
02:06:16,416 --> 02:06:17,416
Let's go.

1513
02:06:29,041 --> 02:06:30,125
Excuse me?

1514
02:06:30,208 --> 02:06:32,291
- Are you a supervisor?
- Yes, I am.

1515
02:06:32,375 --> 02:06:34,583
That officer was very rude to me.

1516
02:06:34,666 --> 02:06:36,541
I've been living here for 15 years,

1517
02:06:36,625 --> 02:06:39,833
and he says I have not the right
to call this my home.

1518
02:06:39,916 --> 02:06:41,083
It was very upsetting.

1519
02:06:41,166 --> 02:06:44,458
- What is your status here, sir?
- I have an O-1 visa.

1520
02:06:44,541 --> 02:06:46,291
Then yes, you can call this your home.

1521
02:06:46,375 --> 02:06:50,291
Well, if he's the face of this nation,
then you should do something.

1522
02:06:50,375 --> 02:06:52,125
It was very humiliating.

1523
02:06:52,208 --> 02:06:54,416
I'm sorry about this, sir.
I'll take care of it.

1524
02:07:07,750 --> 02:07:09,458
The bastard should apologize.

1525
02:07:11,916 --> 02:07:13,333
This man is upset.

1526
02:07:13,416 --> 02:07:15,809
- He said you humiliated him.
- In no way was I disrespectful.

1527
02:07:15,833 --> 02:07:18,833
- He was aggressive.
- No, I need him to give us an apology.

1528
02:07:18,916 --> 02:07:21,416
- Sir, I'll take care of it.
- No, I need an apology.

1529
02:07:21,500 --> 02:07:22,833
What's up? Drop it.

1530
02:07:22,916 --> 02:07:25,500
No, I need this guy
to say this is our home.

1531
02:07:25,583 --> 02:07:27,833
- This is not your home, sir.
- What did you say?

1532
02:07:27,916 --> 02:07:30,041
- Those are the rules.
- What rules?

1533
02:07:30,125 --> 02:07:32,791
This person has an O-1 visa,
and his family, an O-3.

1534
02:07:32,875 --> 02:07:34,458
They're allowed to call this home.

1535
02:07:34,541 --> 02:07:36,500
- You hear that?
- Please apologize to them.

1536
02:07:36,583 --> 02:07:38,875
No, this is not their home.
They're not Americans.

1537
02:07:38,958 --> 02:07:41,750
What are you?
Mexican, Chinese, fucking Swedish?

1538
02:07:41,833 --> 02:07:44,017
- Sir.
- I grew up here. Went to school here.

1539
02:07:44,041 --> 02:07:46,875
- This is our home, you like it or not.
- Please control your son.

1540
02:07:46,958 --> 02:07:47,875
No!

1541
02:07:47,958 --> 02:07:49,878
He should shut up
and be respectful.

1542
02:07:49,916 --> 02:07:52,583
I'm tired of this bullshit
since I was a kid in this country.

1543
02:07:52,666 --> 02:07:56,166
Okay, if you want to call
this place your home, so be it.

1544
02:07:56,250 --> 02:07:57,791
Hey, look us in the eye.

1545
02:07:57,875 --> 02:08:00,434
- You can't talk to him like that.
- You speak Spanish?

1546
02:08:00,458 --> 02:08:03,017
- You look more Mexican than I do.
- Don't understand.

1547
02:08:03,041 --> 02:08:05,458
Are you afraid
they'll realize you're Mexican?

1548
02:08:05,541 --> 02:08:06,581
I'm American.

1549
02:08:06,625 --> 02:08:09,166
America is a continent, asshole.
We're all Americans too.

1550
02:08:09,250 --> 02:08:10,570
They stole our name.

1551
02:08:10,625 --> 02:08:12,875
- He understands.
- He hasn't apologized.

1552
02:08:12,958 --> 02:08:15,041
- Just fucking apologize.
- Say you're sorry.

1553
02:08:15,125 --> 02:08:17,517
- Say you are sorry.
- Say you are sorry.

1554
02:08:19,333 --> 02:08:21,583
- Say you are sorry!
- Don't touch me!

1555
02:08:22,083 --> 02:08:23,559
- Come on!
- Don't touch me!

1556
02:08:23,583 --> 02:08:24,583
Say it!

1557
02:08:28,708 --> 02:08:30,148
Say you're sorry! Say it!

1558
02:08:30,208 --> 02:08:32,416
Lorenzo!

1559
02:08:34,458 --> 02:08:35,375
<i>Papá!</i>

1560
02:08:45,833 --> 02:08:47,793
This is a really nice home
you guys have.

1561
02:08:47,833 --> 02:08:48,666
Thank you.

1562
02:08:48,750 --> 02:08:51,291
Oh, you're very welcome.
Thank you. Have a good day.

1563
02:08:53,166 --> 02:08:55,541
Lorenzo, move your suitcase!

1564
02:08:55,625 --> 02:08:57,541
Okay, I'll do it.

1565
02:09:12,875 --> 02:09:15,583
I'm gonna take a walk.
I still have a headache.

1566
02:09:15,666 --> 02:09:17,186
Come here. Lie down for a bit.

1567
02:09:17,250 --> 02:09:20,541
See if you can change
the old walrus look on your face.

1568
02:09:20,625 --> 02:09:23,416
You can't go to the awards ceremony
looking like that.

1569
02:09:43,291 --> 02:09:45,333
<i>They would have you believe</i>

1570
02:09:45,416 --> 02:09:47,041
<i>that Jesus Christ was a white man.</i>

1571
02:09:47,833 --> 02:09:48,833
That's a lie.

1572
02:09:48,916 --> 02:09:52,041
Jesus wasn't no white man.
Jesus was a brown man!

1573
02:09:52,125 --> 02:09:55,416
And in fact,
truth be told, he was Palestinian.

1574
02:09:55,500 --> 02:09:56,416
Hey!

1575
02:10:00,208 --> 02:10:01,875
You believe in God, right?

1576
02:10:01,958 --> 02:10:03,333
You got faith, right?

1577
02:10:56,291 --> 02:10:58,333
Oh. Excuse me? Excuse me, sir?

1578
02:11:08,791 --> 02:11:11,541
<i>Welcome aboard the Metro Expo Line.</i>

1579
02:11:11,625 --> 02:11:14,208
<i>This train's final destination is</i>

1580
02:11:14,708 --> 02:11:16,708
<i>Downtown Santa Monica station.</i>

1581
02:11:19,291 --> 02:11:22,875
<i>The next stop is Expo Park/USC station.</i>

1582
02:11:46,125 --> 02:11:47,458
<i>Now arriving.</i>

1583
02:11:47,958 --> 02:11:53,416
<i>Exit here for... California Science Center,
Natural History Museum.</i>

1584
02:11:53,500 --> 02:11:56,416
No, leave them alone.

1585
02:11:57,666 --> 02:11:59,625
Leave me alone, Grandma.

1586
02:12:02,500 --> 02:12:04,250
Go, go. Dude.

1587
02:12:10,208 --> 02:12:13,166
<i>Please stand clear.
The doors are closing.</i>

1588
02:13:15,791 --> 02:13:20,583
<i>Now arriving</i>,
<i>7th Street/Metro Center in Downtown LA.</i>

1589
02:13:21,791 --> 02:13:27,291
<i>As far as this train goes.</i>

1590
02:13:27,791 --> 02:13:32,041
<i>Please check...</i>

1591
02:13:45,875 --> 02:13:47,541
Shit.

1592
02:13:54,375 --> 02:13:55,458
Sir...

1593
02:13:58,250 --> 02:14:01,333
<i>Please check
you have all of your personal belongings.</i>

1594
02:14:01,416 --> 02:14:02,291
You okay?

1595
02:14:02,375 --> 02:14:04,495
<i>Hold on until the doors have opened.</i>

1596
02:14:06,125 --> 02:14:07,125
Sir?

1597
02:14:08,333 --> 02:14:10,125
Are you okay, mister?

1598
02:14:13,458 --> 02:14:14,916
Do you need help?

1599
02:14:16,000 --> 02:14:18,240
Can I help you, sir?

1600
02:14:18,791 --> 02:14:20,166
I don't understand.

1601
02:14:24,458 --> 02:14:26,098
I don't understand you, sir.

1602
02:14:26,166 --> 02:14:27,500
Sir?

1603
02:14:31,166 --> 02:14:32,708
I don't understand you.

1604
02:14:37,541 --> 02:14:40,416
Juan! Juan!

1605
02:14:42,500 --> 02:14:43,708
911?

1606
02:15:08,375 --> 02:15:09,625
Good evening.

1607
02:15:11,041 --> 02:15:12,875
I'm proud to be here tonight,

1608
02:15:12,958 --> 02:15:15,750
representing my father
and our whole family.

1609
02:15:17,250 --> 02:15:20,083
The last few days have been
the saddest of my life,

1610
02:15:20,166 --> 02:15:22,375
but today I choose to be proud and happy.

1611
02:15:23,166 --> 02:15:25,500
I'm going to read you my father's speech.

1612
02:15:26,000 --> 02:15:28,708
He carried it with him.

1613
02:15:31,083 --> 02:15:34,875
"Dear colleagues
of the American Society of Journalists..."

1614
02:15:36,541 --> 02:15:37,750
That's all.

1615
02:15:40,458 --> 02:15:43,166
My father isn't big
on being in the spotlight.

1616
02:15:43,666 --> 02:15:47,833
One might say he suffered the stroke
to avoid coming to the ceremony.

1617
02:15:49,125 --> 02:15:52,166
He's probably
in his coma laughing at us.

1618
02:15:53,916 --> 02:15:56,416
Silverio Gama loves California.

1619
02:15:58,000 --> 02:16:01,416
He chose to live here
the last 20 years of his life.

1620
02:16:01,500 --> 02:16:03,791
And he chose to raise us here.

1621
02:16:04,958 --> 02:16:08,958
So I'm sure he's proud
this country he got used to calling home

1622
02:16:09,041 --> 02:16:11,583
is giving him such a prestigious award.

1623
02:16:14,416 --> 02:16:17,000
He also missed Mexico
every day of his life.

1624
02:16:17,958 --> 02:16:22,166
Before watching the video
his colleague and friend, Martín Solís,

1625
02:16:22,250 --> 02:16:23,875
edited for us tonight,

1626
02:16:23,958 --> 02:16:25,833
I would like to ask all of you

1627
02:16:25,916 --> 02:16:29,166
to please give a huge round of applause

1628
02:16:29,250 --> 02:16:32,166
to my father, this year's honoree,

1629
02:16:32,250 --> 02:16:33,791
Silverio Gama.

1630
02:16:47,041 --> 02:16:48,625
Come on, louder!

1631
02:16:51,833 --> 02:16:53,041
Louder!

1632
02:17:07,416 --> 02:17:08,896
<i>Is that normal?</i>

1633
02:17:08,958 --> 02:17:11,583
<i>- What?
- That sound. Is it normal?</i>

1634
02:17:12,083 --> 02:17:13,375
Yes, it's normal.

1635
02:17:13,458 --> 02:17:15,375
The sheets are soaked.

1636
02:17:15,458 --> 02:17:17,875
He's wet.

1637
02:17:17,958 --> 02:17:21,166
Maybe the bag was full.
I think they forgot to change it.

1638
02:17:21,250 --> 02:17:22,833
I'll call the nurse.

1639
02:17:22,916 --> 02:17:25,416
Do you see
any improvement, Doctor?

1640
02:17:26,208 --> 02:17:28,916
No. All we can do is wait.

1641
02:17:29,000 --> 02:17:31,208
There's a major hemorrhage in one lobe.

1642
02:17:31,291 --> 02:17:34,041
- This could take a long time.
- How long?

1643
02:17:34,875 --> 02:17:36,583
I don't know.

1644
02:17:37,333 --> 02:17:40,125
Do you think he's here with us?

1645
02:17:40,625 --> 02:17:42,000
Can he hear us?

1646
02:17:43,333 --> 02:17:44,666
Sure, he's here.

1647
02:17:45,708 --> 02:17:47,541
But at the same time, he's not.

1648
02:17:47,625 --> 02:17:51,750
A coma is basically a mystery, Camila.

1649
02:17:51,833 --> 02:17:53,708
What's he doing with his eyes?

1650
02:17:54,333 --> 02:17:55,625
It's a reflex.

1651
02:17:56,125 --> 02:17:59,458
It feels like he's squeezing
when I take his hand.

1652
02:18:00,083 --> 02:18:02,083
Yesterday we put on some music

1653
02:18:02,166 --> 02:18:04,500
and some recordings
from when we were kids,

1654
02:18:04,583 --> 02:18:06,333
and he cried a little.

1655
02:18:07,458 --> 02:18:08,625
<i>Silverio...</i>

1656
02:18:09,333 --> 02:18:10,583
Can you hear me?

1657
02:18:14,541 --> 02:18:16,000
Where are you?

1658
02:18:17,458 --> 02:18:19,208
I feel you can hear me.

1659
02:18:21,666 --> 02:18:23,583
Have you seen the remote?

1660
02:18:23,666 --> 02:18:24,583
No.

1661
02:18:24,666 --> 02:18:29,208
<i>...the main subject in discussion,
off-the-record, the revolutionary sale.</i>

1662
02:18:29,291 --> 02:18:30,666
<i>Moving down the...</i>

1663
02:18:30,750 --> 02:18:33,208
<i>No one
lifted a finger to help him.</i>

1664
02:18:33,291 --> 02:18:36,541
<i>At the train's last stop,
he was the last passenger.</i>

1665
02:18:36,625 --> 02:18:38,225
<i>A cleaning lady found him.</i>

1666
02:18:38,250 --> 02:18:41,708
<i>A compatriot of ours,
Ms. Refugio Domínguez.</i>

1667
02:18:41,791 --> 02:18:43,208
<i>Hello, Refugio.</i>

1668
02:18:43,291 --> 02:18:45,625
<i>- Hi.
- We caught up with her.</i>

1669
02:18:45,708 --> 02:18:48,125
<i>We'll have the pleasure
of speaking with her.</i>

1670
02:18:48,208 --> 02:18:50,541
<i>Thanks for joining us.
Tell us what happened.</i>

1671
02:18:50,625 --> 02:18:55,000
<i>I went in to clean the car,
as usual, and saw it wasn't empty.</i>

1672
02:18:55,083 --> 02:18:59,041
<i>I thought the guy might be a drunk
because that's common here.</i>

1673
02:18:59,541 --> 02:19:03,125
<i>But then I saw the fish on the floor.</i>

1674
02:19:14,958 --> 02:19:16,125
Silverio...

1675
02:19:20,666 --> 02:19:21,916
Silverio...

1676
02:19:24,458 --> 02:19:25,875
How are you feeling?

1677
02:19:28,583 --> 02:19:30,125
You seem tired.

1678
02:19:30,958 --> 02:19:32,125
Peaceful.

1679
02:19:34,375 --> 02:19:35,458
Tranquil.

1680
02:19:35,958 --> 02:19:39,375
What the fuck was my dad doing
on the Santa Monica train?

1681
02:19:39,458 --> 02:19:42,041
He wanted to feel more Mexican.

1682
02:19:42,125 --> 02:19:46,541
But with all those Mexicans around,
his head exploded.

1683
02:19:48,958 --> 02:19:50,708
You're such an asshole.

1684
02:19:51,208 --> 02:19:54,541
Something weird happened a few days ago
in our bedroom in Los Angeles.

1685
02:19:54,625 --> 02:19:57,625
I was sleeping on my stomach,

1686
02:19:58,250 --> 02:20:01,291
and something grabbed my feet
and started pulling.

1687
02:20:01,375 --> 02:20:05,750
It jerked me upward.
There was nothing I could do.

1688
02:20:06,583 --> 02:20:08,458
The dream was so real.

1689
02:20:08,958 --> 02:20:13,333
And I'm sure it happened
right when Silverio had his stroke.

1690
02:20:18,291 --> 02:20:21,000
Thanks for bringing him
to Mexico.

1691
02:24:01,875 --> 02:24:04,166
Hey, Pa!

1692
02:24:06,416 --> 02:24:10,375
Hey, Pa! What's the name of that song?

1693
02:24:10,458 --> 02:24:13,833
I don't remember the name,
but I love it.

1694
02:24:13,916 --> 02:24:16,166
You always do the same thing.

1695
02:24:16,250 --> 02:24:18,875
You take something away,
then you don't remember.

1696
02:24:18,958 --> 02:24:21,875
But Ma, you always danced
to that song with Papa.

1697
02:24:21,958 --> 02:24:23,750
Son, your father was a drag.

1698
02:24:23,833 --> 02:24:27,583
He never liked dancing,
and it's my favorite thing in the world.

1699
02:24:27,666 --> 02:24:30,333
Tough men don't dance.

1700
02:24:30,416 --> 02:24:34,166
I was comfortable
at home watching TV,

1701
02:24:34,250 --> 02:24:36,583
and look where you've taken me.

1702
02:24:36,666 --> 02:24:39,583
All I wanted was to see
the end of the movie.

1703
02:24:39,666 --> 02:24:43,958
Okay, Ma, but can someone tell me
the name of that song?

1704
02:24:44,041 --> 02:24:45,625
What are you talking about?

1705
02:24:45,708 --> 02:24:48,333
Brother, do you remember
the name of that song

1706
02:24:48,416 --> 02:24:50,333
Papa whistled to us when we were kids?

1707
02:24:50,416 --> 02:24:52,166
Where did you bring us, brother?

1708
02:24:52,250 --> 02:24:54,500
He never even whistled me a <i>ranchera.</i>

1709
02:24:54,583 --> 02:24:56,708
Don't leave again, darky.

1710
02:24:56,791 --> 02:24:58,208
Come back.

1711
02:24:58,291 --> 02:25:02,500
You're leaving without putting me
in one of your movies.

1712
02:25:02,583 --> 02:25:04,958
Not even as one of those extras.

1713
02:25:06,750 --> 02:25:08,000
Keep going!

1714
02:25:21,250 --> 02:25:23,392
- Where are you coming from?
- From the North!

1715
02:25:23,416 --> 02:25:28,166
From hell, but they don't even know
they're living in hell.

1716
02:25:28,250 --> 02:25:29,690
Where are you taking him?

1717
02:25:29,750 --> 02:25:32,750
To the South.
We'll use this piece to resuscitate him.

1718
02:25:32,833 --> 02:25:34,958
He will rebuild himself completely.

1719
02:25:35,041 --> 02:25:37,000
Let the whole world look to the south!

1720
02:25:37,083 --> 02:25:39,750
How do you know
it's in that direction?

1721
02:27:03,458 --> 02:27:04,583
Pa!

1722
02:27:09,000 --> 02:27:10,375
Lorenzo!

1723
02:27:10,458 --> 02:27:13,416
You need to go the other way!

1724
02:27:14,291 --> 02:27:15,833
No, Pa!

1725
02:27:15,916 --> 02:27:17,541
We're going with you!

1726
02:27:17,625 --> 02:27:18,958
Turn around!

1727
02:27:19,041 --> 02:27:21,333
There's nothing here for you!

1728
02:27:21,416 --> 02:27:22,625
And you?

1729
02:27:23,791 --> 02:27:25,458
I'll see you when I'm back!

1730
02:27:26,375 --> 02:27:28,166
When might that be?

1731
02:27:31,666 --> 02:27:33,166
When?

1732
02:27:34,166 --> 02:27:35,708
<i>Papá!</i>
